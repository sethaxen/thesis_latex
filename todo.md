Now:
    X Fix table formatting/missing eqref
    Expand intro
    Expand abstract
    Write acknowledgments
    Expand SHG section
    Add experimental benchmark for SHG
    Add synthetic benchmark for NOE
    Add ensemble paper refs
    Write about tilt series and such

Later:
    Add refs to each section of Appendix A
    Number all major equations, link back to theorems and such
    Add refs for different types of normal distributions.
    Add figures:
        4 stage SHG fig
        4 stage NOE fig?
        Kinematic tree/ensemble fig?
        f_i curves for SHG
        plots of Brownian polar distribution fig
    Glossary?


1. Sketch out SHG main text
    - pull from appendix and from derivation doc
    - Intro
        + something about problem
        + into to SHG
        + intro to TPF with SHG
        + problem of fitting distribution
        + tomography
        + how to integrate SHG and TPF and multiple data points to inform same structural DOFs?
        + discuss problems with wrapped normal approach and spherical approach
    - Approach
        + introduce kinematic ensemble approach for SO(3)
        + limiting case of brownian rotation/spherical motion, explicit forms of equations
        + synthetic benchmark
            - (single body on surface), compare with in silico predictions
            - rotamer library for PyMPO
            - two rigid bodies
            - multiple orientations on surface
        + real benchmark
            - principles (check primer or another of Andrej's papers)
            - independent data?
    
2. Sketch out intro text
    - problem of representing three-dimensional molecules and their ensembles
    - different regimes, in machine learning, a representation is an encoding of data into features on which some ML model will be trained. The primary feature you want is to not induce unnecessary structure, must be in right format (usually arrays). need not be interpretable, does not need to be sampled.
    - in inference, the representation is the language in which models of the some system can be expressed. It must be useful and feasible; usefulness...
    "representations are important because..."
    - small molecule methods
    - macromolecular methods
    - paragraph about ensemble representations at opposite ends of this spectrum
3. Sketch out abstract
4. Revisit Chapter 3 (handle Jaime's and Matt's concerns)
5. Add frontmatter
6. Fix table in Chapter 1
7. Format check
