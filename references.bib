The information content of the CSD, together with methods for data acquisition, processing and validation, are summarized, with particular emphasis on the chemical information added by CSD editors. Nearly 80\% of new structural data arrives electronically, mostly in CIF format, and the CCDC acts as the official crystal structure data depository for 51 major journals. The CCDC now maintains both a CIF archive (more than 73,000 CIFs dating from 1996), as well as the distributed binary CSD archive; the availability of data in both archives is discussed. A statistical survey of the CSD is also presented and projections concerning future accession rates indicate that the CSD will contain at least 500,000 crystal structures by the year 2010.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tools to explore large compound databases in search for analogs of query molecules provide a strategically important support in drug discovery to help identify available analogs of any given reference or hit compound by ligand based virtual screening (LBVS). We recently showed that large databases can be formatted for very fast searching with various 2D-fingerprints using the city-block distance as similarity measure, in particular a 2D-atom pair fingerprint (APfp) and the related category extended atom pair fingerprint (Xfp) which efficiently encode molecular shape and pharmacophores, but do not perceive stereochemistry. Here we investigated related 3D-atom pair fingerprints to enable rapid stereoselective searches in the ZINC database (23.2 million 3D structures). RESULTS: Molecular fingerprints counting atom pairs at increasing through-space distance intervals were designed using either all atoms (16-bit 3DAPfp) or different atom categories (80-bit 3DXfp). These 3D-fingerprints retrieved molecular shape and pharmacophore analogs (defined by OpenEye ROCS scoring functions) of 110,000 compounds from the Cambridge Structural Database with equal or better accuracy than the 2D-fingerprints APfp and Xfp, and showed comparable performance in recovering actives from decoys in the DUD database. LBVS by 3DXfp or 3DAPfp similarity was stereoselective and gave very different analogs when starting from different diastereomers of the same chiral drug. Results were also different from LBVS with the parent 2D-fingerprints Xfp or APfp. 3D- and 2D-fingerprints also gave very different results in LBVS of folded molecules where through-space distances between atom pairs are much shorter than topological distances. CONCLUSIONS: 3DAPfp and 3DXfp are suitable for stereoselective searches for shape and pharmacophore analogs of query molecules in large databases. Web-browsers for searching ZINC by 3DAPfp and 3DXfp similarity are accessible at www.gdb.unibe.ch and should provide useful assistance to drug discovery projects. Graphical abstractAtom pair fingerprints based on through-space distances (3DAPfp) provide better shape encoding than atom pair fingerprints based on topological distances (APfp) as measured by the recovery of ROCS shape analogs by fp similarity.},

  abstract = {The binding of drugs and reagents to off-targets is well-known. Whereas many off-targets are related to the primary target by sequence and fold, many ligands bind to unrelated pairs of proteins, and these are harder to anticipate. If the binding site in the off-target can be related to that of the primary target, this challenge resolves into aligning the two pockets. However, other cases are possible: the ligand might interact with entirely different residues and environments in the off-target, or wholly different ligand atoms may be implicated in the two complexes. To investigate these scenarios at atomic resolution, the structures of 59 ligands in 116 complexes (62 pairs in total), where the protein pairs were unrelated by fold but bound an identical ligand, were examined. In almost half of the pairs, the ligand interacted with unrelated residues in the two proteins (29 pairs), and in 14 of the pairs wholly different ligand moieties were implicated in each complex. Even in those 19 pairs of complexes that presented similar environments to the ligand, ligand superposition rarely resulted in the overlap of related residues. There appears to be no single pattern-matching "code" for identifying binding sites in unrelated proteins that bind identical ligands, though modeling suggests that there might be a limited number of different patterns that suffice to recognize different ligand functional groups.},

A transcription factor is tethered to a membrane-bound receptor with a linker that contains a cleavage site for a specific protease. Activation of the receptor recruits a signaling protein fused to the protease that then cleaves and releases the transcription factor to activate reporter genes in the nucleus. This strategy converts a transient interaction into a stable and amplifiable reporter gene signal to record the activation of a receptor without interference from endogenous signaling pathways. We have developed this assay for three classes of receptors: G protein-coupled receptors, receptor tyrosine kinases, and steroid hormone receptors. Finally, we use the assay to identify a ligand for the orphan receptor GPR1, suggesting a role for this receptor in the regulation of inflammation.},

  abstract = {Little is known about the physiological roles of the M5 muscarinic receptor, the last member of the muscarinic receptor family (M1-M5) to be cloned. In the brain, the M5 receptor subtype is preferentially expressed by dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area. Dopaminergic neurons located in the ventral tegmental area are known to play important roles in mediating both the rewarding effects of opiates and other drugs of abuse and the manifestations of opiate/drug withdrawal symptoms. We therefore speculated that acetylcholine-dependent activation of M5 receptors might modulate the manifestations of opiate reward and withdrawal. This hypothesis was tested in a series of behavioral, biochemical, and neurochemical studies using M5 receptor-deficient mice (M5-/- mice) as novel experimental tools. We found that the rewarding effects of morphine, as measured in the conditioned place preference paradigm, were substantially reduced in M5-/- mice. Furthermore, both the somatic and affective components of naloxone-induced morphine withdrawal symptoms were significantly attenuated in M5-/- mice. In contrast, the analgesic efficacy of morphine and the development of tolerance to the analgesic effects of morphine remained unaltered by the lack of M5 receptors. The finding that M5 receptor activity modulates both morphine reward and withdrawal processes suggests that M5 receptors may represent a novel target for the treatment of opiate addiction.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Neural networks are becoming a very popular method for solving machine learning and artificial intelligence problems. The variety of neural network types and their application to drug discovery requires expert knowledge to choose the most appropriate approach. AREAS COVERED: In this review, the authors discuss traditional and newly emerging neural network approaches to drug discovery. Their focus is on backpropagation neural networks and their variants, self-organizing maps and associated methods, and a relatively new technique, deep learning. The most important technical issues are discussed including overfitting and its prevention through regularization, ensemble and multitask modeling, model interpretation, and estimation of applicability domain. Different aspects of using neural networks in drug discovery are considered: building structure-activity models with respect to various targets; predicting drug selectivity, toxicity profiles, ADMET and physicochemical properties; characteristics of drug-delivery systems and virtual screening. EXPERT OPINION: Neural networks continue to grow in importance for drug discovery. Recent developments in deep learning suggests further improvements may be gained in the analysis of large chemical data sets. It's anticipated that neural networks will be more widely used in drug discovery in the future, and applied in non-traditional areas such as drug delivery systems, biologically compatible materials, and regenerative medicine.},

However, designing drugs with a specific multi-target profile is both complex and difficult. Therefore methods to design drugs rationally a priori against profiles of several proteins would have immense value in drug discovery. Here we describe a new approach for the automated design of ligands against profiles of multiple drug targets. The method is demonstrated by the evolution of an approved acetylcholinesterase inhibitor drug into brain-penetrable ligands with either specific polypharmacology or exquisite selectivity profiles for G-protein-coupled receptors. Overall, 800 ligand-target predictions of prospectively designed ligands were tested experimentally, of which 75\% were confirmed to be correct. We also demonstrate target engagement in vivo. The approach can be a useful source of drug leads when multi-target profiles are required to achieve either selectivity over other drug targets or a desired polypharmacology.},

  abstract = {Modeling a complex system is almost invariably a challenging task. The incorporation of experimental observations can be used to improve the quality of a model and thus to obtain better predictions about the behavior of the corresponding system. This approach, however, is affected by a variety of different errors, especially when a system simultaneously populates an ensemble of different states and experimental data are measured as averages over such states. To address this problem, we present a Bayesian inference method, called ``metainference,'' that is able to deal with errors in experimental measurements and with experimental measurements averaged over multiple states. To achieve this goal, metainference models a finite sample of the distribution of models using a replica approach, in the spirit of the replica-averaging modeling based on the maximum entropy principle. To illustrate the method, we present its application to a heterogeneous model system and to the determination of an ensemble of structures corresponding to the thermal fluctuations of a protein molecule. Metainference thus provides an approach to modeling complex systems with heterogeneous components and interconverting between different states by taking into account all possible sources of errors.},

  abstract = {This paper defines an angular velocity for time-dependent functions on the sphere and applies it to gravitational waveforms from compact binaries. Because it is geometrically meaningful and has a clear physical motivation, the angular velocity is uniquely useful in helping to solve an important\textemdash and largely ignored\textemdash problem in models of compact binaries: the inverse problem of deducing the physical parameters of a system from the gravitational waves alone. It is also used to define the corotating frame of the waveform. When decomposed in this frame, the waveform has no rotational dynamics and is therefore as slowly evolving as possible. The resulting simplifications lead to straightforward methods for accurately comparing waveforms and constructing hybrids. As formulated in this paper, the methods can be applied robustly to both precessing and nonprecessing waveforms, providing a clear, comprehensive, and consistent framework for waveform analysis. Explicit implementations of all these methods are provided in accompanying computer code.},

With sufficiently rich phenotyping and a large sampling of compounds, it should be possible to identify compounds with desired mechanisms of action on the basis of behavioral profiles alone. Although zebrafish (Danio rerio) behavior has been used to rapidly identify neuroactive compounds, it is not clear what types of behavioral assays would be necessary to identify multitarget compounds such as antipsychotics. Here we developed a battery of behavioral assays in larval zebrafish to determine whether behavioral profiles can provide sufficient phenotypic resolution to identify and classify psychiatric drugs. Using the antipsychotic drug haloperidol as a test case, we found that behavioral profiles of haloperidol-treated zebrafish could be used to identify previously uncharacterized compounds with desired antipsychotic-like activities and multitarget mechanisms of action.},

In such cases, a simpler approach based on group fusion would appear to provide superior screening performance, especially when structurally heterogeneous datasets are to be processed.},

This updated molecular set has been used herein to develop 4D QSAR models based on "inductive" descriptors and to gain insight into the molecular basis of protein-ligand interactions. Molecular alignment was generated by means of docking active compounds into the active site of the SHBG. Surprisingly, the alignment of the benchmark steroids contradicted the classical ligand-based alignment utilized in previous CoMFA and CoMSIA models yet afforded models with higher statistical significance and predictive power. The resulting QSAR models combined with CoMFA and CoMSiA models as well as structure-based virtual screening allowed discovering several low-micromolar to nanomolar nonsteroidal inhibitors for human SHBG.},

          , 
            
              Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) has emerged as a highly sensitive probe of protein conformation. SHG can also be used to determine the tilt angle of an SHG-active moiety bound to a surface-adsorbed protein through polarization-dependent measurements. However, due to the coherent nature of SHG, interference occurs between the SHG produced by the SHG-active moieties and background sources at a solid\textendash liquid interface, obscuring the signal of interest. In order to separate the protein-specific signal from the background signal, the phase difference between these two different sources of SHG must be determined. Although the phase difference can be obtained through a conventional interferometric approach involving a phase-modulated SHG source external to the sample, it can be sensitive to drift and other instabilities. We present here a simple, convenient, and crucially, model-independent method to determine the phase difference for any system in which the intensity of SHG-active moieties can be varied. We demonstrate the approach with time-resolved measurements of an SHG-active labeled protein binding to a supported lipid bilayer surface using a total internal reflection (TIR) geometry. This approach requires no additional optics beyond what is required to measure SHG and is highly stable since the interferometry occurs
              in situ
              , within the sample over a nanometer length scale, rather than external to it. To validate our measurements and the general approach, we constructed a dual-beam, external SHG interferometer in a TIR geometry. We also validated our approach by applying the
              in situ
              method to previously published measurements of the phase difference, obtaining the same values without recourse to a specific adsorption model.},

Different methods for ligand-based predictive modeling have different inductive biases, with a particularly sharp contrast between 2D and 3D similarity methods. A unique aspect of ligand design is that the data that exist to test methodology have been largely man-made, and that this process of design involves prediction. By analyzing the molecular similarities of known drugs, we show that the inductive bias of the historic drug discovery process has a very strong 2D bias. In studying the performance of ligand-based modeling methods, it is critical to account for this issue in dataset preparation, use of computational controls, and in the interpretation of results. We propose specific strategies to explicitly address the problems posed by inductive bias considerations.},

In order to determine whether efficacy for the sigma receptor could be improved, a series of compounds related to the benzeneacetamides, N-substituted cis-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-N-methylcyclohexylamines, were synthesized and their structure-activity requirements were determined. The compounds were synthesized by starting with the previously reported (+/-)-, 1S,2R-(+)-, and 1R,2S-(-)-cis-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-N-methylcyclohexylamines. Analysis of sigma ([3H](+)-3-PPP), kappa ([3H]bremazocine and [3H]U69,593), dopamine-d2 ([3H](-)-sulpiride), and phencyclidine (PCP) ([3H]TCP) receptor binding in guinea pig brain revealed a number of highly potent and selective sigma receptor ligands. Notably, 1S,2R-cis-(-)-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl]-(2-naphthyl) acetamide [(-)-29] (Ki = 8.66 +/- 0.35 nM), (+/-)-cis-2-amino-4,5-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl] benzeneacetamide [(+/-)-17] (Ki = 11 +/- 3 nM), 1S,2R-(-)-cis-N-methyl-N-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl ) cyclohexylamine [(-)-44] (Ki = 1.3 +/- 0.3 nM), and 1R,2S-(+)-cis-N-methyl-N-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl ) cyclohexylamine. [(+)-44] (Ki = 6 +/- 3 nM) exhibited very high affinity at sigma receptors, by displacement of [3H]-(+)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-(1-propyl)piperidine [( 3H]-(+)-3-PPP). These compounds showed insignificant affinity for kappa, dopamine, or PCP receptors, making them valuable tools for the study of sigma receptors. Furthermore, these compounds also exhibited enantioselectivity ranging from 5-fold for (+)- and (-)-44 to 160-fold for (+)- and (-)-29. Several other compounds showed equivalent selectivity but displayed lower sigma receptor affinity.},

The inhibition of PFTase has profound consequences for oncogenesis, as well as a number of other diseases. In the present study, two commercial drugs, Loratadine and Miconazole, were identified as potential ligands for PFTase and subsequently confirmed as such experimentally. These results point toward the applicability of SEA for the prediction of not only GPCR-GPCR drug cross talk but also GPCR-enzyme and enzyme-enzyme drug cross talk.},

  abstract = {The sc-PDB database (available at http://bioinfo-pharma.u-strasbg.fr/scPDB/) is a comprehensive and up-to-date selection of ligandable binding sites of the Protein Data Bank. Sites are defined from complexes between a protein and a pharmacological ligand. The database provides the all-atom description of the protein, its ligand, their binding site and their binding mode. Currently, the sc-PDB archive registers 9283 binding sites from 3678 unique proteins and 5608 unique ligands. The sc-PDB database was publicly launched in 2004 with the aim of providing structure files suitable for computational approaches to drug design, such as docking. During the last 10 years we have improved and standardized the processes for (i) identifying binding sites, (ii) correcting structures, (iii) annotating protein function and ligand properties and (iv) characterizing their binding mode. This paper presents the latest enhancements in the database, specifically pertaining to the representation of molecular interaction and to the similarity between ligand/protein binding patterns. The new website puts emphasis in pictorial analysis of data. The Author(s) 2014. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.},

We examine the performance of four freely available small molecule conformer generation tools (Balloon, Confab, Frog2, and RDKit) alongside a commercial tool (MOE). The aim of this study is 3-fold: (i) to identify which tools most accurately reproduce experimentally determined structures; (ii) to examine the diversity of the generated conformational set; and (iii) to benchmark the computational time expended. These aspects were tested using a set of 708 drug-like molecules assembled from the OMEGA validation set and the Astex Diverse Set. These molecules have varying physicochemical properties and at least one known X-ray crystal structure. We found that RDKit and Confab are statistically better than other methods at generating low rmsd conformers to the known structure. RDKit is particularly suited for less flexible molecules while Confab, with its systematic approach, is able to generate conformers which are geometrically closer to the experimentally determined structure for molecules with a large number of rotatable bonds ({$\geq$}10). In our tests RDKit also resulted as the second fastest method after Frog2. In order to enhance the performance of RDKit, we developed a postprocessing algorithm to build a diverse and representative set of conformers which also contains a close conformer to the known structure. Our analysis indicates that, with postprocessing, RDKit is a valid free alternative to commercial, proprietary software.},

These M5 receptors modulate the activity of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, which play an important role in mediating reinforcing properties of abused psychostimulants like cocaine. The potential role of M5 receptors in the reinforcing effects of cocaine was investigated using M5 receptor-deficient mice in a model of acute cocaine self-administration. The M5-deficient mice self-administered cocaine at a significantly lower rate than wild-type controls. In the conditioned place preference procedure, a classic test for evaluating the rewarding properties of drugs, M5-deficient mice spent significantly less time in the cocaine-paired compartment than control mice. Moreover, the severity of the cocaine withdrawal syndrome (withdrawal-associated anxiety measured in the elevated plus-maze) was significantly attenuated in mice lacking the M5 receptor. These results demonstrate that M5 receptors play an important role in mediating both cocaine-associated reinforcement and withdrawal. Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Psychostimulants are first-line treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but their tolerability profiles and individual response variability fuel a continuing search for alternative medications. The observation that nicotinic agents improve cognition has led pharmaceutical companies to explore the potential utility of agonists of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) system for ADHD treatments. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews Phase I and Phase II trials of sofinicline (ABT-894), an agonist of the nAChR {$\alpha$}4{$\beta$}2 subtype, as a potential non-stimulant treatment for ADHD. This includes one Phase II trial that compared sofinicline with atomoxetine, a noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor currently approved as a non-stimulant ADHD treatment. This article also reviews the chemistry, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of sofinicline. EXPERT OPINION: Sofinicline appears to be well tolerated and showing efficacy similar to that of atomoxetine. Although the number of patients studied to date is small, further evaluation of sofinicline in Phase II, and possibly Phase III, trials appears to be warranted. Additional studies are needed to explore the efficacy and tolerability of sofinicline with respect to: i) optimal dosing; ii) its use in combination with other medications for ADHD; and iii) its use in children and adolescents, who more commonly experience adverse effects when taking psychostimulant medications.},

The classifiers were obtained using sets of known COX-2 and thrombin inhibitors as "positive examples" and a large collection of screening compounds as "negative examples". Molecules were encoded by topological pharmacophore-point triangles. In retrospective virtual screening, 50-90\% of the known active compounds were listed within the first 0.1\% of the ranked database. To check the validity of the constructed classifiers, we developed a method for feature extraction and visualization using SVM. As a result, potential pharmacophore points were weighted according to their importance for COX-2 and thrombin inhibition. Known thrombin and COX-2 pharmacophore points were correctly recognized by the machine learning system. In a prospective virtual screening study, several potential COX-2 inhibitors were predicted and tested in a cellular activity assay. A benzimidazole derivative exhibited significant inhibitory activity with an IC(50) of 0.2 microM, which is better than Celecoxib in our assay. It was demonstrated that the SVM machine-learning method can be used in virtual screening and be analyzed in a human-interpretable way that results in a set of rules for designing novel molecules.},

Surprisingly, ethyl- and higher alkylphosphinic acid derivatives of GABA yielded novel GABAB antagonists, which are described in part 2 of this series.

Potencies for inhibition of hiNOS and the human neuronal constitutive enzyme (hnNOS) are comparable. Substitution in the 3 and 7 positions provides compounds that exhibit the greatest degree of selectivity for hiNOS and hnNOS over heNOS. Submicromolar potencies for 6 and 7 in a mouse RAW cell assay demonstrated the ability of these compounds to inhibit iNOS in a cellular environment.

This paper reviews three distinct ways of carrying out such searches when multiple bioactive reference structures are available: merging the individual fingerprints into a single combined fingerprint; applying data fusion to the similarity rankings resulting from individual similarity searches; and approximations to substructural analysis. Extended searches on the MDL Drug Data Report database suggest that fusing similarity scores is the most effective general approach, with the best individual results coming from the binary kernel discrimination technique.},

We calculated the similarities between hundreds of drug targets and their ligands and mapped the relationship between them in a formal network. Bioinformatics networks were based on the BLAST similarity between sequences, while chemoinformatics networks were based on the ligand-set similarities calculated with either the Similarity Ensemble Approach (SEA) or a method derived from Bayesian statistics. By multiple criteria, bioinformatics and chemoinformatics networks differed substantially, and only occasionally did a high sequence similarity correspond to a high ligand-set similarity. In contrast, the chemoinformatics networks were stable to the method used to calculate the ligand-set similarities and to the chemical representation of the ligands. Also, the chemoinformatics networks were more natural and more organized, by network theory, than their bioinformatics counterparts: ligand-based networks were found to be small-world and broad-scale.},

  abstract = {A primary goal of 3D similarity searching is to find compounds with similar bioactivity to a reference ligand but with different chemotypes, i.e., "scaffold hopping". However, an adequate description of chemical structures in 3D conformational space is difficult due to the high-dimensionality of the problem. We present an automated method that simplifies flexible 3D chemical descriptions in which clustering techniques traditionally used in data mining are exploited to create "fuzzy" molecular representations called FEPOPS (feature point pharmacophores). The representations can be used for flexible 3D similarity searching given one or more active compounds without a priori knowledge of bioactive conformations or pharmacophores. We demonstrate that similarity searching with FEPOPS significantly enriches for actives taken from in-house high-throughput screening datasets and from MDDR activity classes COX-2, 5-HT3A, and HIV-RT, while also scaffold or ring-system hopping to new chemical frameworks. Further, inhibitors of target proteins (dopamine 2 and retinoic acid receptor) are recalled by FEPOPS by scaffold hopping from their associated endogenous ligands (dopamine and retinoic acid). Importantly, the method excels in comparison to commonly used 2D similarity methods (DAYLIGHT, MACCS, Pipeline Pilot fingerprints) and a commercial 3D method (Pharmacophore Distance Triplets) at finding novel scaffold classes given a single query molecule.},

As an annotation resource, the following improvements have been made. First, each KO record is re-examined and associated with protein sequence data used in experiments of functional characterization. Second, the GENES database now includes viruses, plasmids, and the addendum category for functionally characterized proteins that are not represented in complete genomes. Third, new automatic annotation servers, BlastKOALA and GhostKOALA, are made available utilizing the non-redundant pangenome data set generated from the GENES database.

Graph convolutions use a simple encoding of the molecular graph-atoms, bonds, distances, etc.-which allows the model to take greater advantage of information in the graph structure. Although graph convolutions do not outperform all fingerprint-based methods, they (along with other graph-based methods) represent a new paradigm in ligand-based virtual screening with exciting opportunities for future improvement.},

A statistical model was developed to rank the significance of the resulting similarity scores, which are expressed as a minimum spanning tree to map the sets together. Although these maps are connected solely by chemical similarity, biologically sensible clusters nevertheless emerged. Links among unexpected targets also emerged, among them that methadone, emetine and loperamide (Imodium) may antagonize muscarinic M3, alpha2 adrenergic and neurokinin NK2 receptors, respectively. These predictions were subsequently confirmed experimentally. Relating receptors by ligand chemistry organizes biology to reveal unexpected relationships that may be assayed using the ligands themselves.},

  abstract = {Molecular biology now dominates pharmacology so thoroughly that it is difficult to recall that only a generation ago the field was very different. To understand drug action today, we characterize the targets through which they act and new drug leads are discovered on the basis of target structure and function. Until the mid-1980s the information often flowed in reverse: investigators began with organic molecules and sought targets, relating receptors not by sequence or structure but by their ligands. Recently, investigators have returned to this chemical view of biology, bringing to it systematic and quantitative methods of relating targets by their ligands. This has allowed the discovery of new targets for established drugs, suggested the bases for their side effects, and predicted the molecular targets underlying phenotypic screens. The bases for these new methods, some of their successes and liabilities, and new opportunities for their use are described.},

  abstract = {The sc-PDB is a collection of 6 415 three-dimensional structures of binding sites found in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Binding sites were extracted from all high-resolution crystal structures in which a complex between a protein cavity and a small-molecular-weight ligand could be identified. Importantly, ligands are considered from a pharmacological and not a structural point of view. Therefore, solvents, detergents, and most metal ions are not stored in the sc-PDB. Ligands are classified into four main categories: nucleotides ({$<$}4-mer), peptides ({$<$}9-mer), cofactors, and organic compounds. The corresponding binding site is formed by all protein residues (including amino acids, cofactors, and important metal ions) with at least one atom within 6.5 angstroms of any ligand atom. The database was carefully annotated by browsing several protein databases (PDB, UniProt, and GO) and storing, for every sc-PDB entry, the following features: protein name, function, source, domain and mutations, ligand name, and structure. The repository of ligands has also been archived by diversity analysis of molecular scaffolds, and several chemoinformatics descriptors were computed to better understand the chemical space covered by stored ligands. The sc-PDB may be used for several purposes: (i) screening a collection of binding sites for predicting the most likely target(s) of any ligand, (ii) analyzing the molecular similarity between different cavities, and (iii) deriving rules that describe the relationship between ligand pharmacophoric points and active-site properties. The database is periodically updated and accessible on the web at http://bioinfo-pharma.u-strasbg.fr/scPDB/.},

  abstract = {Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly heritable, common psychiatric disorder that presents in childhood and that probably involves several genes. There are several lines of evidence suggesting that the nicotinic system may be functionally significant in ADHD: (a) nicotine promotes the release of dopamine and has been shown to improve attention in adults with ADHD, smokers and non-smokers; (b) ADHD is a significant risk factor for early initiation of cigarette smoking in children; (c) maternal cigarette smoking appears to be a risk factor for ADHD; (d) animal studies in rats and monkeys also suggest that nicotine may be involved in attentional systems and locomotor activity; and (e) a central nicotinic agonist, ABT-418, improves attention in both monkeys and ADHD adults. The current study examined the alpha 4 receptor, one of the sites of action of ABT-418. A known Cfol polymorphism within the nicotinic acetylcholine alpha 4 receptor gene, CHRNA4, was studied in 70 ADHD parent-proband trios from an ongoing sample collection of children aged 6-12 with ADHD, according to DSM-IV criteria. Children with known major medical or psychiatric conditions or mental retardation (IQ {$<$}70) were excluded from the study. The Transmission Disequilibrium Test demonstrated no evidence that variation at the nicotinic acetylcholine alpha 4 receptor Cfol polymorphism influences susceptibility to ADHD (P {$>$}0.35). The continuing sample collection will enable further study of other potential nicotinic system polymorphisms in ADHD in more powerful samples.},

A survey of experimental data on a large number of the strongest-binding ligands indicates that the free energy of binding increases with the number of nonhydrogen atoms with an initial slope of approximately -1.5 kcal/mol (1 cal = 4.18 J) per atom. For ligands that contain more than 15 nonhydrogen atoms, the free energy of binding increases very little with relative molecular mass. This nonlinearity is largely ascribed to nonthermodynamic factors. An analysis of the dominant interactions suggests that van der Waals interactions and hydrophobic effects provide a reasonable basis for understanding binding affinities across the entire set of ligands. Interesting outliers that bind unusually strongly on a per atom basis include metal ions, covalently attached ligands, and a few well known complexes such as biotin-avidin.},

Using the structure-activity relationships of C2-symmetric diol inhibitors, computed-aided drug design tools, and first principles, we designed and synthesized a novel class of cyclic ureas that incorporates this structural water and preorganizes the side chain residues into optimum binding conformations. Conformational analysis suggested a preference for pseudodiaxial benzylic and pseudodiequatorial hydroxyl substituents and an enantiomeric preference for the Rstereochemistry. The X-ray and solution NMR structure of the complex of HIV-1PR and one such cyclic urea, DMP323, confirmed the displacement of the structural water. Additionally, the bound and "unbound" (small-molecule X-ray) ligands have similar conformations. The high degree of preorganization, the complementarity, and the entropic gain of water displacement are proposed to explain the high affinity of these small molecules for the enzyme. The small size probably contributes to the observed good oral bioavailability in animals. Extensive structure-based optimization of the side chains that fill the S2 and S2' pockets of the enzyme resulted in DMP323, which was studied in phase I clinical trials but found to suffer from variable pharmacokinetics in man. This report details the synthesis, conformational analysis, structure-activity relationships, and molecular recognition of this series of C2-symmetry HIV-1PR inhibitors. An initial series of cyclic ureas containing nonsymmetric P2/P2' is also discussed.},

These generalizations of curves and surfaces to arbitrarily many dimensions provide the mathematical context for under\- standing "space" in all of its manifestations.

No longer a specialized subject that is studied only by differential geometers, manifold theory is now one of the basic skills that all mathematics students should acquire as early as possible. Over the past few centuries, mathematicians have developed a wondrous collection of conceptual machines designed to enable us to peer ever more deeply into the invisible world of geometry in higher dimensions. Once their operation is mastered, these powerful machines enable us to think geometrically about the 6-dimensional zero set of a polynomial in four complex variables, or the lO-dimensional manifold of 5 x 5 orthogonal ma\- trices, as easily as we think about the familiar 2-dimensional sphere in ]R3.},

  abstract = {Phenotypic screens can identify molecules that are at once penetrant and active on the integrated circuitry of a whole cell or organism. These advantages are offset by the need to identify the targets underlying the phenotypes. Additionally, logistical considerations limit screening for certain physiological and behavioral phenotypes to organisms such as zebrafish and C. elegans. This further raises the challenge of elucidating whether compound-target relationships found in model organisms are preserved in humans. To address these challenges we searched for compounds that affect feeding behavior in C. elegans and sought to identify their molecular mechanisms of action. Here, we applied predictive chemoinformatics to small molecules previously identified in a C. elegans phenotypic screen likely to be enriched for feeding regulatory compounds. Based on the predictions, 16 of these compounds were tested in vitro against 20 mammalian targets. Of these, nine were active, with affinities ranging from 9 nM to 10 . Four of these nine compounds were found to alter feeding. We then verified the in vitro findings in vivo through genetic knockdowns, the use of previously characterized compounds with high affinity for the four targets, and chemical genetic epistasis, which is the effect of combined chemical and genetic perturbations on a phenotype relative to that of each perturbation in isolation. Our findings reveal four previously unrecognized pathways that regulate feeding in C. elegans with strong parallels in mammals. Together, our study addresses three inherent challenges in phenotypic screening: the identification of the molecular targets from a phenotypic screen, the confirmation of the in vivo relevance of these targets, and the evolutionary conservation and relevance of these targets to their human orthologs.},

Systems pharmacology-the integration of systems biology and chemical genomics-can illuminate drug mechanisms of action. We hypothesize that these data can improve drug safety surveillance by highlighting drugs with a mechanistic connection to the target phenotype (enriching true positives) and filtering those that do not (depleting false positives).

Drugs can act on several protein targets, some of which can be unrelated by conventional molecular metrics, and hundreds of proteins have been implicated in side effects. Here we use a computational strategy to predict the activity of 656 marketed drugs on 73 unintended 'side-effect' targets. Approximately half of the predictions were confirmed, either from proprietary databases unknown to the method or by new experimental assays. Affinities for these new off-targets ranged from 1 nM to 30 {$\mu$}M. To explore relevance, we developed an association metric to prioritize those new off-targets that explained side effects better than any known target of a given drug, creating a drug-target-adverse drug reaction network. Among these new associations was the prediction that the abdominal pain side effect of the synthetic oestrogen chlorotrianisene was mediated through its newly discovered inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-1. The clinical relevance of this inhibition was borne out in whole human blood platelet aggregation assays. This approach may have wide application to de-risking toxicological liabilities in drug discovery.},

The method, an extension to the ChemDiverse/Chem-X software (Oxford Molecular, Oxford, England), has also been customized to enable a new internally referenced measure of pharmacophore diversity. The "privileged" substructure concept for the design of high-affinity ligands is presented, and an example of this new method is described for the design of combinatorial libraries for 7-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor targets, where "privileged" substructures are used as special features to internally reference the pharmacophoric shapes. Up to 7 features and 15 distance ranges are considered, giving up to 350 million potential 4-point 3D pharmacophores/molecule. The resultant pharmacophore "key" ("fingerprint") serves as a powerful measure for diversity or similarity, calculable for both a ligand and a protein site, and provides a consistent frame of reference for comparing molecules, sets of molecules, and protein sites. Explicit "on-the-fly" conformational sampling is performed for a molecule to enable the calculation of all geometries accessible for all combinations of four features (i.e., 4-point pharmacophores) at any desired sampling resolution. For a protein site, complementary site points to groups displayed in the site are generated and all combinations of four site points are considered. In this paper we report (i) the details of our customized implementation of the method and its modification to systematically measure 4-point pharmacophores relative to a "special" substructure of interest present in the molecules under study; (ii) comparisons of 3- and 4-point pharmacophore methods, highlighting the much increased resolution of the 4-point method; (iii) applications of the 4-point potential pharmacophore descriptors as a new measure of molecular similarity and diversity and for the design of focused/biased combinatorial libraries.},

  abstract = {The efficiency of the drug discovery process can be significantly improved using design techniques to maximize the diversity of structure databases or combinatorial libraries. Here, several physicochemical descriptors were investigated to quantify molecular diversity. Based on the 2D or 3D topological similarity of molecules, the relationship between physicochemical metrics and biological activity was studied to find valid descriptors. Several compounds were selected using those descriptors from a database containing diverse templates and 55 biological classes. It was evaluated whether the obtained subsets represent all biological properties and structural variations of the original database. In addition, hierarchical cluster analyses were used to group molecules from the parent database, which should have similar biological properties. Using various sets of structurally similar molecules, it was possible to derive quantitative measures for compound similarities in relation to biological properties. A similarity radius for 2D fingerprints and molecular steric fields was estimated; compounds within this radius of another molecule were shown to have comparable biological properties. This study demonstrates that 2D fingerprints alone or in combination with other metrics as the primary descriptor allow to handle global diversity. In addition, standard atom-pair descriptors or molecular steric fields can be used to correlate structural diversity with biological activity. Hence, the latter two descriptors can be classified as secondary descriptors useful for analog library design, while 2D fingerprints are applicable to design a general library for lead discovery. Based on these findings, an optimally diverse subset containing only 38\% of the entire IC93 database was generated using 2D fingerprints. Here no structure is more similar than 0.85 to any other (Tanimoto coefficient), but all biological classes were selected. This reduction of redundancy led to a child database with the same physicochemical diversity space, which contains the same information as the original database.},

Anpirtoline (1.0 ng kg(-1)-1.0 micrograms kg-1 i.p.) reduced the aversive responding of mice. This was detected as an increase in the latency to locate the non-aversive compartment and by decreases in the percentage of the time spent in the dark compartment, and the numbers of rears and line crossings in the dark compartment. In radioligand binding studies anpirtoline displayed submicromolar affinity for 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT3 receptor recognition sites (Ki = 151, 28 and 30 nM, respectively) and more modest affinity for 5-HT2 receptor recognition sites (Ki = 1.48 microM). It is concluded that anpirtoline has a unique spectrum of affinity for 5-HT receptor subtypes, its interaction with which may account for its anxiolytic-like activity.},

As part of our ongoing research program, we have prepared S-oxidized variants of (-)-3, compounds (-)-10, (+)-11 (LY404040), and (-)-12 (LY404039). Each of these chiral heterobicyclic amino acids displaced specific binding of the mGlu2/3 receptor antagonist 3H-2S-2-amino-2-(1S,2S-2-carboxycycloprop-1-yl)-3-(xanth-9-yl)propanoic acid (3H-LY341495) from membranes expressing recombinant human mGlu2 or mGlu3 and acted as potent agonists in cells expressing these receptor subtypes. Docking of the most potent of these derivatives, (+)-11, to mGlu2 revealed the possibility of an additional H-bond interaction between the sulfoxide oxygen of (+)-11 with tyrosine residue Y236. Pharmacokinetic analysis of mGlu active enantiomers (+)-11 and (-)-12 in rats showed each to be well absorbed following oral administration. Consistent with their mGlu2/3 agonist potency and pharmacokinetic properties, both (+)-11 and (-)-12 blocked phencyclidine-evoked ambulations in a dose-dependent manner, indicating their potential as nonclassical antipsychotic agents.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: A central premise of medicinal chemistry is that structurally similar molecules exhibit similar biological activities. Molecular fingerprints encode properties of small molecules and assess their similarities computationally through bit string comparisons. Based on the similarity to a biologically active template, molecular fingerprint methods allow for identifying additional compounds with a higher chance of displaying similar biological activities against the same target - a process commonly referred to as virtual screening (VS). AREAS COVERED: This article focuses on fingerprint similarity searches in the context of compound selection for enhancing hit sets, comparing compound decks, and VS. In addition, the authors discuss the application of fingerprints in predictive modeling. EXPERT OPINION: Fingerprint similarity search methods are especially useful in VS if only a few unrelated ligands are known for a given target and therefore more complex and information rich methods such as pharmacophore searches or structure-based design are not applicable. In addition, fingerprint methods are used in characterizing properties of compound collections such as chemical diversity, density in chemical space, and content of biologically active molecules (biodiversity). Such assessments are important for deciding what compounds to experimentally screen, to purchase, or to assemble in a virtual compound deck for in silico screening or de novo design.},

  abstract = {The eight contributions here provide ample evidence that shape as a volume or as a surface is a vibrant and useful concept when applied to drug discovery. It provides a reliable scaffold for "decoration" with chemical intuition (or bias) for virtual screening and lead optimization but also has its unadorned uses, as in library design, ligand fitting, pose prediction, or active site description. Computing power has facilitated this evolution by allowing shape to be handled precisely without the need to reduce down to point descriptors or approximate metrics, and the diversity of resultant applications argues for this being an important step forward. Certainly, it is encouraging that as computation has enabled our intuition, molecular shape has consistently surprised us in its usefulness and adaptability. The first Aurelius question, "What is the essence of a thing?", seems well answered, however, the third, "What do molecules do?", only partly so. Are the topics covered here exhaustive, or is there more to come? To date, there has been little published on the use of the volumetric definition of shape described here as a QSAR variable, for instance, in the prediction or classification of activity, although other shape definitions have been successful applied, for instance, as embodied in the Compass program described above in "Shape from Surfaces". Crystal packing is a phenomenon much desired to be understood. Although powerful models have been applied to the problem, to what degree is this dominated purely by the shape of a molecule? The shape comparison described here is typically of a global nature, and yet some importance must surely be placed on partial shape matching, just as the substructure matching of chemical graphs has proved useful. The approach of using surfaces, as described here, offers some flavor of this, as does the use of metrics that penalize volume mismatch less than the Tanimoto, e.g., Tversky measures. As yet, there is little to go on as to how useful a paradigm this will be because there is less software and fewer concrete results.Finally, the distance between molecular shapes, or between any shapes defined as volumes or surfaces, is a metric property in the mathematical sense of the word. As yet, there has been little, if any, application of this observation. We cannot know what new application to the design and discovery of pharmaceuticals may yet arise from the simple concept of molecular shape, but it is fair to say that the progress so far is impressive.},

This is equivalent to computing the action of a certain matrix function on the vector representing the initial condition. The matrix function is a linear combination of the matrix exponential and other functions related to the exponential (the so-called phi-functions). Such computations are the major computational burden in the implementation of exponential integrators, which can solve general ODEs. Our approach is to compute the action of the matrix function by constructing a Krylov subspace using Arnoldi or Lanczos iteration and projecting the function on this subspace. This is combined with time-stepping to prevent the Krylov subspace from growing too large. The algorithm is fully adaptive: it varies both the size of the time steps and the dimension of the Krylov subspace to reach the required accuracy. We implement this algorithm in the Matlab function phipm and we give instructions on how to obtain and use this function. Various numerical experiments show that the phipm function is often significantly more efficient than the state-of-the-art.},

analogous to the normal distribution in the Eucledian space. It is possible to obtain
explicit expressions for density of normal distribution only for special cases. One of these
cases is the circular normal distribution.
            
            The connection of the circular normal distribution SO(3) group with the fundamental
solution of the corresponding diffusion equation is shown. It is proved that convolution
of two circular normal distributions is again a distribution of the same type. Some projections
of the normal distribution are obtained. These projections coincide with a
wrapped normal distribution on the unit circle and with the Perrin distribution on the
two-dimensional sphere. In the general case, the normal distribution on SO(3) can
be found numerically. Some algorithms for numerical computations are given. These
investigations were motivated by the orientation distribution function reproduction

The present compounds behaved as competitive muscarinic antagonists in the urinary bladder. The highest receptor binding affinity, Ki (cortex) = 9.6 nM, was observed for 3-(2-benzofuranyl)quinuclidin-2-ene (31). The corresponding 3-benzofuranyl (36) and 3-benzothienyl (37) homologues had about 3.5-fold lower affinity for cortical muscarinic receptors. All quinuclidin-3-ol derivatives (14 and 16-25) had lower binding affinities for the different muscarinic receptor subtypes than the corresponding quinuclidin-2-ene analogues when examined in the various tissue homogenates. In general, the new compounds showed low subtype selectivity. The structure-affinity relationships are discussed in terms of differences in proton basicity of the azabicyclic nitrogen and differences in geometric, conformational, and/or electronic properties of the compounds. The cortical antimuscarinic potency is also related to the complementarity of the compounds to the putative binding site of the muscarinic m1 receptor.},

  abstract = {In medical image analysis and high level computer vision, there is an intensive use of geometric features like orientations, lines, and geometric transformations ranging from simple ones (orientations, lines, rigid body or affine transformations, etc.) to very complex ones like curves, surfaces, or general diffeomorphic transformations. The measurement of such geometric primitives is generally noisy in real applications and we need to use statistics either to reduce the uncertainty (estimation), to compare observations, or to test hypotheses. Unfortunately, even simple geometric primitives often belong to manifolds that are not vector spaces. In previous works [1, 2], we investigated invariance requirements to build some statistical tools on transformation groups and homogeneous manifolds that avoids paradoxes. In this paper, we consider finite dimensional manifolds with a Riemannian metric as the basic structure. Based on this metric, we develop the notions of mean value and covariance matrix of a random element, normal law, Mahalanobis distance and {$\chi$}2 law. We provide a new proof of the characterization of Riemannian centers of mass and an original gradient descent algorithm to efficiently compute them. The notion of Normal law we propose is based on the maximization of the entropy knowing the mean and covariance of the distribution. The resulting family of pdfs spans the whole range from uniform (on compact manifolds) to the point mass distribution. Moreover, we were able to provide tractable approximations (with their limits) for small variances which show that we can effectively implement and work with these definitions.},

Because chemical compounds are often represented by the graph of their covalent bonds, machine learning methods in this domain must be capable of processing graphical structures with variable size. Here, we first briefly review the literature on graph kernels and then introduce three new kernels (Tanimoto, MinMax, Hybrid) based on the idea of molecular fingerprints and counting labeled paths of depth up to d using depth-first search from each possible vertex. The kernels are applied to three classification problems to predict mutagenicity, toxicity, and anti-cancer activity on three publicly available data sets. The kernels achieve performances at least comparable, and most often superior, to those previously reported in the literature reaching accuracies of 91.5\% on the Mutag dataset, 65-67\% on the PTC (Predictive Toxicology Challenge) dataset, and 72\% on the NCI (National Cancer Institute) dataset. Properties and tradeoffs of these kernels, as well as other proposed kernels that leverage 1D or 3D representations of molecules, are briefly discussed.},

We investigate several aspects of the multitask framework by performing a series of empirical studies and obtain some interesting results: (1) massively multitask networks obtain predictive accuracies significantly better than single-task methods, (2) the predictive power of multitask networks improves as additional tasks and data are added, (3) the total amount of data and the total number of tasks both contribute significantly to multitask improvement, and (4) multitask networks afford limited transferability to tasks not in the training set. Our results underscore the need for greater data sharing and further algorithmic innovation to accelerate the drug discovery process.},

Similarity is an appealing approach because, with many fingerprint types, it provides intuitive results: a chemist looking at two molecules can understand why they have been determined to be similar. This transparency is partially lost with the fuzzier similarity methods that are often used for scaffold hopping and tends to vanish completely when molecular fingerprints are used as inputs to machine-learning (ML) models. Here we present similarity maps, a straightforward and general strategy to visualize the atomic contributions to the similarity between two molecules or the predicted probability of a ML model. We show the application of similarity maps to a set of dopamine D3 receptor ligands using atom-pair and circular fingerprints as well as two popular ML methods: random forests and na\"ive Bayes. An open-source implementation of the method is provided.},

The atomic structure and absolute configuration of (+)-vesamicol were determined by X-ray crystallography. The absolute configuration of (-)-vesamicol is 1R,2R. Structure-activity evidence indicates that (-)-vesamicol does not act as an acetylcholine analogue. Alterations to all three rings can have large effects on potency. Unexpectedly, analogues locking the alcohol and ammonium groups trans-diequatorial or trans-diaxial both exhibit good potency. A potent benzovesamicol family has been discovered that is suitable for facile elaboration of the sort useful in affinity labeling and affinity chromatography applications.

The use of ROCS led to the identification of a set of novel, weakly binding inhibitors with scaffolds presenting synthetic opportunities to further optimize biological affinity and lacking development issues associated with the HTS lead. These ROCS-identified scaffolds would have been missed using other structural similarity approaches such as ISIS 2D fingerprints. X-ray crystallographic analysis of one of the new inhibitors bound to ZipA reveals that the shape comparison approach very accurately predicted the binding mode. These experimental results validate this use of ROCS for chemotype switching or "lead hopping" and suggest that it is of general interest for lead identification in drug discovery endeavors.},

Alternative measures such as positive predictive value (PPV) and the associated Precision/Recall (PRC) plots are used less frequently. Many bioinformatics studies develop and evaluate classifiers that are to be applied to strongly imbalanced datasets in which the number of negatives outweighs the number of positives significantly. While ROC plots are visually appealing and provide an overview of a classifier's performance across a wide range of specificities, one can ask whether ROC plots could be misleading when applied in imbalanced classification scenarios. We show here that the visual interpretability of ROC plots in the context of imbalanced datasets can be deceptive with respect to conclusions about the reliability of classification performance, owing to an intuitive but wrong interpretation of specificity. PRC plots, on the other hand, can provide the viewer with an accurate prediction of future classification performance due to the fact that they evaluate the fraction of true positives among positive predictions. Our findings have potential implications for the interpretation of a large number of studies that use ROC plots on imbalanced datasets.},

A gene cluster comprises the alpha3, alpha5 and beta4 subunits, which coassemble to form functional receptors. We examined the role of the beta4 subunits in nicotine-induced seizures and hypolocomotion in beta4 homozygous null (beta4 -/-) and alpha3 heterozygous (+/-) mice. beta4 -/- mice were less sensitive to the effects of nicotine both at low doses, measured as decreased exploration in an open field, and at high doses, measured as sensitivity to nicotine-induced seizures. Using in situ hybridization probes for the alpha3 and alpha5 subunits, we showed that alpha5 mRNA levels are unchanged, whereas alpha3 mRNA levels are selectively decreased in the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb, and the inferior and the superior colliculus of beta4 -/- brains. alpha3 +/- mice were partially resistant to nicotine-induced seizures when compared to wild-type littermates. mRNA levels for the alpha5 and the beta4 subunits were unchanged in alpha3 +/- brains. Together, these results suggest that the beta4 and the alpha3 subunits are mediators of nicotine-induced seizures and hypolocomotion.},

PyMC3 is a new open source probabilistic programming framework written in Python that uses Theano to compute gradients via automatic differentiation as well as compile probabilistic programs on-the-fly to C for increased speed. Contrary to other probabilistic programming languages, PyMC3 allows model specification directly in Python code. The lack of a domain specific language allows for great flexibility and direct interaction with the model. This paper is a tutorial-style introduction to this software package.},

  abstract = {1. The purpose of the present study was to relate the effects of the novel drug, anpirtoline, on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor subtypes to its antinociceptive and antidepressant-like actions in rodents. 2. Binding assays with rat brain membranes have shown that anpirtoline bound with a much higher affinity to 5-HT1B receptor (Ki = 28 nM) than to 5-HT1A (Ki = 150 nM) and 5-HT2 (Ki = 1.49 microM) receptors. 3. Like 5-HT, anpirtoline concentration-dependently inhibited forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in homogenates from the rat substantia nigra. Both effects were not additive, and could be prevented by 5-HT1B receptor antagonists such as propranolol and penbutolol. 4. In superfused rat and pig brain cortex slices preincubated with [3H]-5-HT, the electrically evoked tritium overflow was inhibited by anpirtoline and 5-HT. Whereas 5-HT was equipotent in both tissues (EC50 = 69 nM), anpirtoline was markedly less potent in pig brain cortex slices (EC50 = 1190 nM) than in rat brain cortex slices (EC50 = 55 nM). The concentration-response curve for anpirtoline was shifted to the right by metitepine in both preparations. 5. In the social behaviour deficit test, anpirtoline and trifluoromethylphenyl-piperazine were effective in reversing the isolation-induced impairments in mice, an effect shown only by compounds with agonist properties at the 5-HT1B receptor. 6. In the electrostimulated pain test using mice, anpirtoline dose-dependently increased the pain threshold with an ED50 of 0.52 mg kg-1, i.p. The antinociceptive activity of anpirtoline was abolished by pretreatment with cyproheptadine or propranolol.7. In the forced swimming test in rats, anpirtoline induced a dose-related increase in swimming activity. With an ED50 value of 4.6mgkg-1, i.p., anpirtoline was 4 times more potent than the two standard compounds imipramine and desipramine. The decrease of immobility time or the increase of active periods in this model of behavioural despair is suggested to be characteristic of antidepressant drugs.8. Anpirtoline exhibits both antinociceptive and antidepressant-like activities in animals. It is probable that anpirtoline elicits these pharmacological effects via its agonist effect on 5-HT1B and 5-HT1A receptors.},

Recently, the surprising prevalence of unstructured regions or entirely disordered proteins under physiological conditions has led to the realization that such intrinsically disordered proteins can be functional even in the absence of a folded structure. However, owing to their broad conformational distributions, many of the properties of unstructured proteins are difficult to describe with the established concepts of structural biology. We have thus seen a reemergence of polymer physics as a versatile framework for understanding their structure and dynamics. An important driving force for these developments has been single-molecule spectroscopy, as it allows structural heterogeneity, intramolecular distance distributions, and dynamics to be quantified over a wide range of timescales and solution conditions. Polymer concepts provide an important basis for relating the physical properties of unstructured proteins to folding and function.},

  abstract = {Advantages like intuitive interpretation, objectivity, general applicability, and its easy, automated calculation make the rmsd (root-mean-squared deviation) the measure of choice for the investigation of the accuracy of conformational model generators. For comparing conformations of a single molecule this is a clearly superior method. Single molecule analysis is, however, a rare scenario. Typically, conformations are generated for huge corporate or external vendor databases of high diversity which are then further investigated with high-throughput computational methods like docking or pharmacophore searching, in virtual screening campaigns. Representative subsets for accuracy investigations of computational methods need to mimic this diversity. Averaged rmsd values over these data sets are frequently used to assess the accuracy of the methods. There are, however, significant weaknesses in rmsd comparisons for such kind of data sets. The interpretation is for example no longer intuitive because what can be expected in terms of good or bad rmsd values crucially depends on the data set composition like size or number of rotatable bonds of the underlying molecules. Further, rmsd lacks normalization which might result in very high averaged rmsd values for highly flexible molecules and thus might completely skew results. We have developed a novel measure to compare conformations of molecules called Torsion Fingerprint Deviation (TFD). It extracts, weights, and compares Torsion Fingerprints from a query molecule and generated conformations under consideration of acyclic bonds as well as ring systems. TFD is alignment-free and overcomes major limitations of rmsd while retaining its advantages.},

  abstract = {Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has the unique advantage of elucidating the structure and dynamics of biomolecules in solution at physiological temperatures, where they are in constant movement on timescales from picoseconds to milliseconds. Such motions have been shown to be critical for enzyme catalysis, allosteric regulation, and molecular recognition. With NMR being particularly sensitive to these timescales, detailed information about the kinetics can be acquired. However, nearly all methods of NMR-based biomolecular structure determination neglect kinetics, which introduces a large approximation to the underlying physics, limiting both structural resolution and the ability to accurately determine molecular flexibility. Here we present the Kinetic Ensemble approach that uses a hierarchy of interconversion rates between a set of ensemble members to rigorously calculate Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) intensities. It can be used to simultaneously refine both temporal and structural coordinates. By generalizing ideas from the extended model free approach, the method can analyze the amplitudes and kinetics of motions anywhere along the backbone or side chains. Furthermore, analysis of a large set of crystal structures suggests that NOE data contains a surprising amount of high-resolution information that is better modeled using our approach. The Kinetic Ensemble approach provides the means to unify numerous types of experiments under a single quantitative framework and more fully characterize and exploit kinetically distinct protein states. While we apply the approach here to the protein ubiquitin and cross validate it with previously derived datasets, the approach can be applied to any protein for which NOE data is available.},

Prediction is made by aggregating (majority vote or averaging) the predictions of the ensemble. We built predictive models for six cheminformatics data sets. Our analysis demonstrates that Random Forest is a powerful tool capable of delivering performance that is among the most accurate methods to date. We also present three additional features of Random Forest: built-in performance assessment, a measure of relative importance of descriptors, and a measure of compound similarity that is weighted by the relative importance of descriptors. It is the combination of relatively high prediction accuracy and its collection of desired features that makes Random Forest uniquely suited for modeling in cheminformatics.},

  abstract = {The "receiver operating characteristic" (ROC) curve method is a well-recognized metric used as an objective way to evaluate the ability of a given test to discriminate between two populations. This facilitates decision-making in a plethora of fields in which a wrong judgment may have serious consequences including clinical diagnosis, public safety, travel security, and economic strategies. When virtual screening is used to speed-up the drug discovery process in pharmaceutical research, taking the right decision upon selecting or discarding a molecule prior to in vitro evaluation is of paramount importance. Characterizing both the ability of a virtual screening workflow to select active molecules and the ability to discard inactive ones, the ROC curve approach is well suited for this critical decision gate. As a case study, the first virtual screening workflow focused on metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 4 (mGlu4R) agonists is reported here. Six compounds out of 38 selected and tested in vitro were shown to have agonist activity on this target of therapeutic interest.},

This routinely occurs when there are aspects of the target distribution that are not well captured by the approximating distribution, in which case more stable estimates can be obtained by modifying extreme importance ratios. We present a new method for stabilizing importance weights using a generalized Pareto distribution fit to the upper tail of the distribution of the simulated importance ratios. The method, which empirically performs better than existing methods for stabilizing importance sampling estimates, includes stabilized effective sample size estimates, Monte Carlo error estimates and convergence diagnostics.},

LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called loo and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

Traditional \$\textbackslash widehat\{R\}\$ will fail to correctly diagnose convergence failures when the chain has a heavy tail or when the variance varies across the chains. In this paper we propose an alternative rank-based diagnostic that fixes these problems. We also introduce a collection of quantile-based local efficiency measures, along with a practical approach for computing Monte Carlo error estimates for quantiles. We suggest that common trace plots should be replaced with rank plots from multiple chains. Finally, we give recommendations for how these methods should be used in practice.},

This paper formulates the problem of steering a very flexible needle through firm tissue as a nonholonomic kinematics problem, and demonstrates how planning can be accomplished using diffusion-based motion planning on the Euclidean group, SE(3). In the present formulation, the tissue is treated as isotropic and no obstacles are present. The bevel tip of the needle is treated as a nonholonomic constraint that can be viewed as a 3D extension of the standard kinematic cart or unicycle. A deterministic model is used as the starting point, and reachability criteria are established. A stochastic differential equation and its corresponding Fokker-Planck equation are derived. The Euler-Maruyama method is used to generate the ensemble of reachable states of the needle tip. Inverse kinematics methods developed previously for hyper-redundant and binary manipulators that use this probability density information are applied to generate needle tip paths that reach the desired targets.},

Comparison of nicotinic drugs in competing for alpha3/beta4 receptor binding sites in this cell line and the binding sites in rat forebrain (predominantly alpha4/beta2 receptors) revealed marked differences in their Ki values, but similar rank orders of potency for agonists were observed, with the exception of anatoxin-A. The affinity of the competitive antagonist dihydro-beta-erythroidine is {$>$}7000 times higher at alpha4/beta2 receptors in rat forebrain than at the alpha3/beta4 receptors in these cells. The alpha3/beta4 nAChRs expressed in this cell line are functional, and in response to nicotinic agonists, 86Rb+ efflux was increased to levels 8-10 times the basal levels. Acetylcholine, (-)-nicotine, cytisine, carbachol, and (+/-)-epibatidine all stimulated 86Rb+ efflux, which was blocked by mecamylamine. The EC50 values for acetylcholine and (-)-nicotine to stimulate 86Rb+ effluxes were 114 +/- 24 and 28 +/- 4 microM, respectively. The rank order of potency of nicotinic antagonists in blocking the function of this alpha3/beta4 receptor was mecamylamine {$>$}d-tubocurarine {$>$}dihydro-beta-erythroidine {$>$}hexamethonium. Mecamylamine, d-tubocurarine, and hexamethonium blocked the function by a noncompetitive mechanism, whereas dihydro-beta-erythroidine blocked the function competitively. The KXalpha3 beta4R2 cell line should prove to be a very useful model for studying this subtype of nAChRs.},

  abstract = {Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are ligand-gated ion channels found throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. They are crucial to normal physiology and have been clearly implicated in nicotine addiction. In addition, they are possible therapeutic targets in a wide range of pathological conditions, including cognitive disorders, Parkinson's disease, and neuropathic pain. Nicotinic ligands are usually classified as agonists (or partial agonists), competitive antagonists, or noncompetitive antagonists. Sazetidine-A is a new nicotinic ligand that shows a different pharmacological profile from any of these known classes of ligands. Sazetidine-A competes with very high binding affinity (Ki approximately 0.5 nM) and selectivity for the alpha4beta2 nAChR subtype (Ki ratio alpha3beta4/alpha4beta2 approximately 24,000). Despite its high affinity, sazetidine-A neither activates nAChR channel function nor prevents channel activation when it is applied simultaneously with nicotine. However, when it is pre-incubated for 10 min with the receptors, it potently blocks nicotine-stimulated alpha4beta2 nAChR function (IC50 approximately 30 nM). The action of sazetidine-A may be explained by its very low affinity for the resting conformation of the alpha4beta2 nAChRs, and its very high affinity for the desensitized state of the receptor. We propose that sazetidine-A is a "silent desensitizer" of nAChRs, meaning that it desensitizes the receptor without first activating it. Furthermore, comparison of the effects of sazetidine-A and nicotine at alpha4beta2 nAChRs suggests that the predominant effects of nicotine and other nicotinic agonists are related to desensitization of the receptors and that sazetidine-A potently mimics these effects.},

At present, the physiological relevance of this receptor subtype remains unknown, primarily because of its low expression levels and the lack of M(5) receptor-selective ligands. To circumvent these difficulties, we used gene targeting technology to generate M(5) receptor-deficient mice (M5R(-/-) mice). M5R(-/-) mice did not differ from their wild-type littermates in various behavioral and pharmacologic tests. However, in vitro neurotransmitter release experiments showed that M(5) receptors play a role in facilitating muscarinic agonist-induced dopamine release in the striatum. Because M(5) receptor mRNA has been detected in several blood vessels, we also investigated whether the lack of M(5) receptors led to changes in vascular tone by using several in vivo and in vitro vascular preparations. Strikingly, acetylcholine, a powerful dilator of most vascular beds, virtually lost the ability to dilate cerebral arteries and arterioles in M5R(-/-) mice. This effect was specific for cerebral blood vessels, because acetylcholine-mediated dilation of extra-cerebral arteries remained fully intact in M5R(-/-) mice. Our findings provide direct evidence that M(5) muscarinic receptors are physiologically relevant. Because it has been suggested that impaired cholinergic dilation of cerebral blood vessels may play a role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease and focal cerebral ischemia, cerebrovascular M(5) receptors may represent an attractive therapeutic target.},

Histamine and serotonin have potent effects on the GI tract. The effects of metformin on histamine and serotonin uptake were evaluated in cell lines overexpressing several amine transporters (OCT1, OCT3 and SERT). Metformin inhibited histamine and serotonin uptake by OCT1, OCT3 and SERT in a dose-dependent manner, with OCT1-mediated amine uptake being most potently inhibited (IC50 = 1.5 mM). A chemoinformatics-based method known as Similarity Ensemble Approach predicted diamine oxidase (DAO) as an additional intestinal target of metformin, with an E-value of 7.4 \texttimes{} 10(-5). Inhibition of DAO was experimentally validated using a spectrophotometric assay with putrescine as the substrate. The Ki of metformin for DAO was measured to be 8.6 {$\pm$} 3.1 mM. In this study, we found that metformin inhibited intestinal amine transporters and DAO at concentrations that may be achieved in the intestine after therapeutic doses. Further studies are warranted to determine the relevance of these interactions to the adverse effects of metformin on the gastrointestinal tract.},

  abstract = {Antagonist activity at the {$\alpha$}3{$\beta$}4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is thought to contribute to the antiaddictive properties of several compounds. However, truly selective ligands for the {$\alpha$}3{$\beta$}4 nAChR have not been available. We report the discovery and SAR of a novel class of compounds that bind to the {$\alpha$}3{$\beta$}4 nAChR and have no measurable affinity for the {$\alpha$}4{$\beta$}2 or {$\alpha$}7 subtype. In functional assays the lead compound antagonized epibatidine-induced Ca(2+) flux in {$\alpha$}3{$\beta$}4-transfected cells in a noncompetitive manner.},
