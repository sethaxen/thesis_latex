	abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo is a key computational tool in Bayesian statistics, but it can be challenging to monitor the convergence of an iterative stochastic algorithm. In this paper we show that the convergence diagnostic \${\textbackslash}widehat\{R\}\$ of Gelman and Rubin (1992) has serious flaws. Traditional \${\textbackslash}widehat\{R\}\$ will fail to correctly diagnose convergence failures when the chain has a heavy tail or when the variance varies across the chains. In this paper we propose an alternative rank-based diagnostic that fixes these problems. We also introduce a collection of quantile-based local efficiency measures, along with a practical approach for computing Monte Carlo error estimates for quantiles. We suggest that common trace plots should be replaced with rank plots from multiple chains. Finally, we give recommendations for how these methods should be used in practice.},

	abstract = {Importance weighting is a general way to adjust Monte Carlo integration to account for draws from the wrong distribution, but the resulting estimate can be noisy when the importance ratios have a heavy right tail. This routinely occurs when there are aspects of the target distribution that are not well captured by the approximating distribution, in which case more stable estimates can be obtained by modifying extreme importance ratios. We present a new method for stabilizing importance weights using a generalized Pareto distribution fit to the upper tail of the distribution of the simulated importance ratios. The method, which empirically performs better than existing methods for stabilizing importance sampling estimates, includes stabilized effective sample size estimates, Monte Carlo error estimates and convergence diagnostics.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo has proven a remarkable empirical success, but only recently have we begun to develop a rigorous understanding of why it performs so well on difficult problems and how it is best applied in practice. Unfortunately, that understanding is confined within the mathematics of differential geometry which has limited its dissemination, especially to the applied communities for which it is particularly important. In this review I provide a comprehensive conceptual account of these theoretical foundations, focusing on developing a principled intuition behind the method and its optimal implementations rather of any exhaustive rigor. Whether a practitioner or a statistician, the dedicated reader will acquire a solid grasp of how Hamiltonian Monte Carlo works, when it succeeds, and, perhaps most importantly, when it fails.},

Because it is geometrically meaningful and has a clear physical motivation, the angular velocity is uniquely useful in helping to solve an important—and largely ignored—problem in models of compact binaries: the inverse problem of deducing the physical parameters of a system from the gravitational waves alone. It is also used to define the corotating frame of the waveform. When decomposed in this frame, the waveform has no rotational dynamics and is therefore as slowly evolving as possible. The resulting simplifications lead to straightforward methods for accurately comparing waveforms and constructing hybrids. As formulated in this paper, the methods can be applied robustly to both precessing and nonprecessing waveforms, providing a clear, comprehensive, and consistent framework for waveform analysis. Explicit implementations of all these methods are provided in accompanying computer code.},

These generalizations of curves and surfaces to arbitrarily many dimensions provide the mathematical context for under­ standing "space" in all of its manifestations. Today, the tools of manifold theory are indispensable in most major subfields of pure mathematics, and outside of pure mathematics they are becoming increasingly important to scientists in such diverse fields as genetics, robotics, econometrics, com­ puter graphics, biomedical imaging, and, of course, the undisputed leader among consumers (and inspirers) of mathematics-theoretical physics. No longer a specialized subject that is studied only by differential geometers, manifold theory is now one of the basic skills that all mathematics students should acquire as early as possible. Over the past few centuries, mathematicians have developed a wondrous collection of conceptual machines designed to enable us to peer ever more deeply into the invisible world of geometry in higher dimensions. Once their operation is mastered, these powerful machines enable us to think geometrically about the 6-dimensional zero set of a polynomial in four complex variables, or the {lO}-dimensional manifold of 5 x 5 orthogonal ma­ trices, as easily as we think about the familiar 2-dimensional sphere in ]R3.},

	abstract = {In medical image analysis and high level computer vision, there is an intensive use of geometric features like orientations, lines, and geometric transformations ranging from simple ones (orientations, lines, rigid body or affine transformations, etc.) to very complex ones like curves, surfaces, or general diffeomorphic transformations. The measurement of such geometric primitives is generally noisy in real applications and we need to use statistics either to reduce the uncertainty (estimation), to compare observations, or to test hypotheses. Unfortunately, even simple geometric primitives often belong to manifolds that are not vector spaces. In previous works [1, 2], we investigated invariance requirements to build some statistical tools on transformation groups and homogeneous manifolds that avoids paradoxes. In this paper, we consider finite dimensional manifolds with a Riemannian metric as the basic structure. Based on this metric, we develop the notions of mean value and covariance matrix of a random element, normal law, Mahalanobis distance and χ2 law. We provide a new proof of the characterization of Riemannian centers of mass and an original gradient descent algorithm to efficiently compute them. The notion of Normal law we propose is based on the maximization of the entropy knowing the mean and covariance of the distribution. The resulting family of pdfs spans the whole range from uniform (on compact manifolds) to the point mass distribution. Moreover, we were able to provide tractable approximations (with their limits) for small variances which show that we can effectively implement and work with these definitions.},

To train these architectures at scale, we gather large amounts of data from public sources to create a dataset of nearly 40 million measurements across more than 200 biological targets. We investigate several aspects of the multitask framework by performing a series of empirical studies and obtain some interesting results: (1) massively multitask networks obtain predictive accuracies significantly better than single-task methods, (2) the predictive power of multitask networks improves as additional tasks and data are added, (3) the total amount of data and the total number of tasks both contribute significantly to multitask improvement, and (4) multitask networks afford limited transferability to tasks not in the training set. Our results underscore the need for greater data sharing and further algorithmic innovation to accelerate the drug discovery process.},

	abstract = {Binary classifiers are routinely evaluated with performance measures such as sensitivity and specificity, and performance is frequently illustrated with Receiver Operating Characteristics ({ROC}) plots. Alternative measures such as positive predictive value ({PPV}) and the associated Precision/Recall ({PRC}) plots are used less frequently. Many bioinformatics studies develop and evaluate classifiers that are to be applied to strongly imbalanced datasets in which the number of negatives outweighs the number of positives significantly. While {ROC} plots are visually appealing and provide an overview of a classifier's performance across a wide range of specificities, one can ask whether {ROC} plots could be misleading when applied in imbalanced classification scenarios. We show here that the visual interpretability of {ROC} plots in the context of imbalanced datasets can be deceptive with respect to conclusions about the reliability of classification performance, owing to an intuitive but wrong interpretation of specificity. {PRC} plots, on the other hand, can provide the viewer with an accurate prediction of future classification performance due to the fact that they evaluate the fraction of true positives among positive predictions. Our findings have potential implications for the interpretation of a large number of studies that use {ROC} plots on imbalanced datasets.},

The new version contains over 120 million purchasable "drug-like" compounds–effectively all organic molecules that are for sale–a quarter of which are available for immediate delivery. {ZINC} connects purchasable compounds to high-value ones such as metabolites, drugs, natural products, and annotated compounds from the literature. Compounds may be accessed by the genes for which they are annotated as well as the major and minor target classes to which those genes belong. It offers new analysis tools that are easy for nonspecialists yet with few limitations for experts. {ZINC} retains its original 3D roots–all molecules are available in biologically relevant, ready-to-dock formats. {ZINC} is freely available at http://zinc15.docking.org.},

Assigning functional meanings to genes and genomes both at the molecular and higher levels is the primary objective of the {KEGG} database project. Molecular-level functions are stored in the {KO} ({KEGG} Orthology) database, where each {KO} is defined as a functional ortholog of genes and proteins. Higher-level functions are represented by networks of molecular interactions, reactions and relations in the forms of {KEGG} pathway maps, {BRITE} hierarchies and {KEGG} modules. In the past the {KO} database was developed for the purpose of defining nodes of molecular networks, but now the content has been expanded and the quality improved irrespective of whether or not the {KOs} appear in the three molecular network databases. The newly introduced addendum category of the {GENES} database is a collection of individual proteins whose functions are experimentally characterized and from which an increasing number of {KOs} are defined. Furthermore, the {DISEASE} and {DRUG} databases have been improved by systematic analysis of drug labels for better integration of diseases and drugs with the {KEGG} molecular networks. {KEGG} is moving towards becoming a comprehensive knowledge base for both functional interpretation and practical application of genomic information.

	abstract = {Phenotypic screens can identify molecules that are at once penetrant and active on the integrated circuitry of a whole cell or organism. These advantages are offset by the need to identify the targets underlying the phenotypes. Additionally, logistical considerations limit screening for certain physiological and behavioral phenotypes to organisms such as zebrafish and C. elegans. This further raises the challenge of elucidating whether compound-target relationships found in model organisms are preserved in humans. To address these challenges we searched for compounds that affect feeding behavior in C. elegans and sought to identify their molecular mechanisms of action. Here, we applied predictive chemoinformatics to small molecules previously identified in a C. elegans phenotypic screen likely to be enriched for feeding regulatory compounds. Based on the predictions, 16 of these compounds were tested in vitro against 20 mammalian targets. Of these, nine were active, with affinities ranging from 9 {nM} to 10 . Four of these nine compounds were found to alter feeding. We then verified the in vitro findings in vivo through genetic knockdowns, the use of previously characterized compounds with high affinity for the four targets, and chemical genetic epistasis, which is the effect of combined chemical and genetic perturbations on a phenotype relative to that of each perturbation in isolation. Our findings reveal four previously unrecognized pathways that regulate feeding in C. elegans with strong parallels in mammals. Together, our study addresses three inherent challenges in phenotypic screening: the identification of the molecular targets from a phenotypic screen, the confirmation of the in vivo relevance of these targets, and the evolutionary conservation and relevance of these targets to their human orthologs.},

The {KEGG} pathway maps, {BRITE} hierarchies and {KEGG} modules are developed as networks of {KO} nodes, representing high-level functions of the cell and the organism. Currently, more than 4000 complete genomes are annotated with {KOs} in the {KEGG} {GENES} database, which can be used as a reference data set for {KO} assignment and subsequent reconstruction of {KEGG} pathways and other molecular networks. As an annotation resource, the following improvements have been made. First, each {KO} record is re-examined and associated with protein sequence data used in experiments of functional characterization. Second, the {GENES} database now includes viruses, plasmids, and the addendum category for functionally characterized proteins that are not represented in complete genomes. Third, new automatic annotation servers, {BlastKOALA} and {GhostKOALA}, are made available utilizing the non-redundant pangenome data set generated from the {GENES} database.

A survey of experimental data on a large number of the strongest-binding ligands indicates that the free energy of binding increases with the number of nonhydrogen atoms with an initial slope of approximately -1.5 kcal/mol (1 cal = 4.18 J) per atom. For ligands that contain more than 15 nonhydrogen atoms, the free energy of binding increases very little with relative molecular mass. This nonlinearity is largely ascribed to nonthermodynamic factors. An analysis of the dominant interactions suggests that van der Waals interactions and hydrophobic effects provide a reasonable basis for understanding binding affinities across the entire set of ligands. Interesting outliers that bind unusually strongly on a per atom basis include metal ions, covalently attached ligands, and a few well known complexes such as biotin-avidin.},

A transcription factor is tethered to a membrane-bound receptor with a linker that contains a cleavage site for a specific protease. Activation of the receptor recruits a signaling protein fused to the protease that then cleaves and releases the transcription factor to activate reporter genes in the nucleus. This strategy converts a transient interaction into a stable and amplifiable reporter gene signal to record the activation of a receptor without interference from endogenous signaling pathways. We have developed this assay for three classes of receptors: G protein-coupled receptors, receptor tyrosine kinases, and steroid hormone receptors. Finally, we use the assay to identify a ligand for the orphan receptor {GPR}1, suggesting a role for this receptor in the regulation of inflammation.},

Here we used {SEA} to look for potential off-target inhibition of the enzyme protein farnesyltransferase ({PFTase}) by commercially available drugs. The inhibition of {PFTase} has profound consequences for oncogenesis, as well as a number of other diseases. In the present study, two commercial drugs, Loratadine and Miconazole, were identified as potential ligands for {PFTase} and subsequently confirmed as such experimentally.

	abstract = {Discovering the unintended 'off-targets' that predict adverse drug reactions is daunting by empirical methods alone. Drugs can act on several protein targets, some of which can be unrelated by conventional molecular metrics, and hundreds of proteins have been implicated in side effects. Here we use a computational strategy to predict the activity of 656 marketed drugs on 73 unintended 'side-effect' targets. Approximately half of the predictions were confirmed, either from proprietary databases unknown to the method or by new experimental assays. Affinities for these new off-targets ranged from 1 {nM} to 30 μM. To explore relevance, we developed an association metric to prioritize those new off-targets that explained side effects better than any known target of a given drug, creating a drug-target-adverse drug reaction network. Among these new associations was the prediction that the abdominal pain side effect of the synthetic oestrogen chlorotrianisene was mediated through its newly discovered inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-1. The clinical relevance of this inhibition was borne out in whole human blood platelet aggregation assays. This approach may have wide application to de-risking toxicological liabilities in drug discovery.},

	abstract = {Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ({nAChRs}) are ligand-gated ion channels found throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. They are crucial to normal physiology and have been clearly implicated in nicotine addiction. In addition, they are possible therapeutic targets in a wide range of pathological conditions, including cognitive disorders, Parkinson's disease, and neuropathic pain. Nicotinic ligands are usually classified as agonists (or partial agonists), competitive antagonists, or noncompetitive antagonists. Sazetidine-A is a new nicotinic ligand that shows a different pharmacological profile from any of these known classes of ligands. Sazetidine-A competes with very high binding affinity (Ki approximately 0.5 {nM}) and selectivity for the alpha4beta2 {nAChR} subtype (Ki ratio alpha3beta4/alpha4beta2 approximately 24,000). Despite its high affinity, sazetidine-A neither activates {nAChR} channel function nor prevents channel activation when it is applied simultaneously with nicotine. However, when it is pre-incubated for 10 min with the receptors, it potently blocks nicotine-stimulated alpha4beta2 {nAChR} function ({IC}50 approximately 30 {nM}). The action of sazetidine-A may be explained by its very low affinity for the resting conformation of the alpha4beta2 {nAChRs}, and its very high affinity for the desensitized state of the receptor. We propose that sazetidine-A is a "silent desensitizer" of {nAChRs}, meaning that it desensitizes the receptor without first activating it. Furthermore, comparison of the effects of sazetidine-A and nicotine at alpha4beta2 {nAChRs} suggests that the predominant effects of nicotine and other nicotinic agonists are related to desensitization of the receptors and that sazetidine-A potently mimics these effects.},

	abstract = {Little is known about the physiological roles of the M5 muscarinic receptor, the last member of the muscarinic receptor family (M1-M5) to be cloned. In the brain, the M5 receptor subtype is preferentially expressed by dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area. Dopaminergic neurons located in the ventral tegmental area are known to play important roles in mediating both the rewarding effects of opiates and other drugs of abuse and the manifestations of opiate/drug withdrawal symptoms. We therefore speculated that acetylcholine-dependent activation of M5 receptors might modulate the manifestations of opiate reward and withdrawal. This hypothesis was tested in a series of behavioral, biochemical, and neurochemical studies using M5 receptor-deficient mice (M5-/- mice) as novel experimental tools. We found that the rewarding effects of morphine, as measured in the conditioned place preference paradigm, were substantially reduced in M5-/- mice. Furthermore, both the somatic and affective components of naloxone-induced morphine withdrawal symptoms were significantly attenuated in M5-/- mice. In contrast, the analgesic efficacy of morphine and the development of tolerance to the analgesic effects of morphine remained unaltered by the lack of M5 receptors. The finding that M5 receptor activity modulates both morphine reward and withdrawal processes suggests that M5 receptors may represent a novel target for the treatment of opiate addiction.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: A central premise of medicinal chemistry is that structurally similar molecules exhibit similar biological activities. Molecular fingerprints encode properties of small molecules and assess their similarities computationally through bit string comparisons. Based on the similarity to a biologically active template, molecular fingerprint methods allow for identifying additional compounds with a higher chance of displaying similar biological activities against the same target - a process commonly referred to as virtual screening ({VS}). {AREAS} {COVERED}: This article focuses on fingerprint similarity searches in the context of compound selection for enhancing hit sets, comparing compound decks, and {VS}. In addition, the authors discuss the application of fingerprints in predictive modeling. {EXPERT} {OPINION}: Fingerprint similarity search methods are especially useful in {VS} if only a few unrelated ligands are known for a given target and therefore more complex and information rich methods such as pharmacophore searches or structure-based design are not applicable. In addition, fingerprint methods are used in characterizing properties of compound collections such as chemical diversity, density in chemical space, and content of biologically active molecules (biodiversity). Such assessments are important for deciding what compounds to experimentally screen, to purchase, or to assemble in a virtual compound deck for in silico screening or de novo design.},

	abstract = {The eight contributions here provide ample evidence that shape as a volume or as a surface is a vibrant and useful concept when applied to drug discovery. It provides a reliable scaffold for "decoration" with chemical intuition (or bias) for virtual screening and lead optimization but also has its unadorned uses, as in library design, ligand fitting, pose prediction, or active site description. Computing power has facilitated this evolution by allowing shape to be handled precisely without the need to reduce down to point descriptors or approximate metrics, and the diversity of resultant applications argues for this being an important step forward. Certainly, it is encouraging that as computation has enabled our intuition, molecular shape has consistently surprised us in its usefulness and adaptability. The first Aurelius question, "What is the essence of a thing?", seems well answered, however, the third, "What do molecules do?", only partly so. Are the topics covered here exhaustive, or is there more to come? To date, there has been little published on the use of the volumetric definition of shape described here as a {QSAR} variable, for instance, in the prediction or classification of activity, although other shape definitions have been successful applied, for instance, as embodied in the Compass program described above in "Shape from Surfaces". Crystal packing is a phenomenon much desired to be understood. Although powerful models have been applied to the problem, to what degree is this dominated purely by the shape of a molecule? The shape comparison described here is typically of a global nature, and yet some importance must surely be placed on partial shape matching, just as the substructure matching of chemical graphs has proved useful. The approach of using surfaces, as described here, offers some flavor of this, as does the use of metrics that penalize volume mismatch less than the Tanimoto, e.g., Tversky measures. As yet, there is little to go on as to how useful a paradigm this will be because there is less software and fewer concrete results.Finally, the distance between molecular shapes, or between any shapes defined as volumes or surfaces, is a metric property in the mathematical sense of the word. As yet, there has been little, if any, application of this observation. We cannot know what new application to the design and discovery of pharmaceuticals may yet arise from the simple concept of molecular shape, but it is fair to say that the progress so far is impressive.},

However, an adequate description of chemical structures in 3D conformational space is difficult due to the high-dimensionality of the problem. We present an automated method that simplifies flexible 3D chemical descriptions in which clustering techniques traditionally used in data mining are exploited to create "fuzzy" molecular representations called {FEPOPS} (feature point pharmacophores). The representations can be used for flexible 3D similarity searching given one or more active compounds without a priori knowledge of bioactive conformations or pharmacophores. We demonstrate that similarity searching with {FEPOPS} significantly enriches for actives taken from in-house high-throughput screening datasets and from {MDDR} activity classes {COX}-2, 5-{HT}3A, and {HIV}-{RT}, while also scaffold or ring-system hopping to new chemical frameworks. Further, inhibitors of target proteins (dopamine 2 and retinoic acid receptor) are recalled by {FEPOPS} by scaffold hopping from their associated endogenous ligands (dopamine and retinoic acid). Importantly, the method excels in comparison to commonly used 2D similarity methods ({DAYLIGHT}, {MACCS}, Pipeline Pilot fingerprints) and a commercial 3D method (Pharmacophore Distance Triplets) at finding novel scaffold classes given a single query molecule.},

Bioinformatics networks were based on the {BLAST} similarity between sequences, while chemoinformatics networks were based on the ligand-set similarities calculated with either the Similarity Ensemble Approach ({SEA}) or a method derived from Bayesian statistics. By multiple criteria, bioinformatics and chemoinformatics networks differed substantially, and only occasionally did a high sequence similarity correspond to a high ligand-set similarity. In contrast, the chemoinformatics networks were stable to the method used to calculate the ligand-set similarities and to the chemical representation of the ligands. Also, the chemoinformatics networks were more natural and more organized, by network theory, than their bioinformatics counterparts: ligand-based networks were found to be small-world and broad-scale.},

We examine the performance of four freely available small molecule conformer generation tools (Balloon, Confab, Frog2, and {RDKit}) alongside a commercial tool ({MOE}). The aim of this study is 3-fold: (i) to identify which tools most accurately reproduce experimentally determined structures; (ii) to examine the diversity of the generated conformational set; and (iii) to benchmark the computational time expended. These aspects were tested using a set of 708 drug-like molecules assembled from the {OMEGA} validation set and the Astex Diverse Set. These molecules have varying physicochemical properties and at least one known X-ray crystal structure. We found that {RDKit} and Confab are statistically better than other methods at generating low rmsd conformers to the known structure. {RDKit} is particularly suited for less flexible molecules while Confab, with its systematic approach, is able to generate conformers which are geometrically closer to the experimentally determined structure for molecules with a large number of rotatable bonds (≥10). In our tests {RDKit} also resulted as the second fastest method after Frog2. In order to enhance the performance of {RDKit}, we developed a postprocessing algorithm to build a diverse and representative set of conformers which also contains a close conformer to the known structure. Our analysis indicates that, with postprocessing, {RDKit} is a valid free alternative to commercial, proprietary software.},

	abstract = {: Fingerprint similarity is a common method for comparing chemical structures. Similarity is an appealing approach because, with many fingerprint types, it provides intuitive results: a chemist looking at two molecules can understand why they have been determined to be similar. This transparency is partially lost with the fuzzier similarity methods that are often used for scaffold hopping and tends to vanish completely when molecular fingerprints are used as inputs to machine-learning ({ML}) models. Here we present similarity maps, a straightforward and general strategy to visualize the atomic contributions to the similarity between two molecules or the predicted probability of a {ML} model. We show the application of similarity maps to a set of dopamine D3 receptor ligands using atom-pair and circular fingerprints as well as two popular {ML} methods: random forests and naïve Bayes. An open-source implementation of the method is provided.},

Because chemical compounds are often represented by the graph of their covalent bonds, machine learning methods in this domain must be capable of processing graphical structures with variable size. Here, we first briefly review the literature on graph kernels and then introduce three new kernels (Tanimoto, {MinMax}, Hybrid) based on the idea of molecular fingerprints and counting labeled paths of depth up to d using depth-first search from each possible vertex. The kernels are applied to three classification problems to predict mutagenicity, toxicity, and anti-cancer activity on three publicly available data sets. The kernels achieve performances at least comparable, and most often superior, to those previously reported in the literature reaching accuracies of 91.5\% on the Mutag dataset, 65-67\% on the {PTC} (Predictive Toxicology Challenge) dataset, and 72\% on the {NCI} (National Cancer Institute) dataset. Properties and tradeoffs of these kernels, as well as other proposed kernels that leverage 1D or 3D representations of molecules, are briefly discussed.},

Another class of method that has shown promise in virtual screening is the shape-based, ligand-centric approach. Several direct comparisons of docking with the shape-based tool {ROCS} have been conducted using data sets from some of these recent docking publications. The results show that a shape-based, ligand-centric approach is more consistent than, and often superior to, the protein-centric approach taken by docking.},

Here we consider a complementary technique that quantitatively groups and relates proteins based on the chemical similarity of their ligands.

A statistical model was developed to rank the significance of the resulting similarity scores, which are expressed as a minimum spanning tree to map the sets together. Although these maps are connected solely by chemical similarity, biologically sensible clusters nevertheless emerged. Links among unexpected targets also emerged, among them that methadone, emetine and loperamide (Imodium) may antagonize muscarinic M3, alpha2 adrenergic and neurokinin {NK}2 receptors, respectively. These predictions were subsequently confirmed experimentally. Relating receptors by ligand chemistry organizes biology to reveal unexpected relationships that may be assayed using the ligands themselves.},

	abstract = {A new 4-point pharmacophore method for molecular similarity and diversity that rapidly calculates all potential pharmacophores/pharmacophoric shapes for a molecule or a protein site is described. The method, an extension to the {ChemDiverse}/Chem-X software (Oxford Molecular, Oxford, England), has also been customized to enable a new internally referenced measure of pharmacophore diversity. The "privileged" substructure concept for the design of high-affinity ligands is presented, and an example of this new method is described for the design of combinatorial libraries for 7-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor targets, where "privileged" substructures are used as special features to internally reference the pharmacophoric shapes. Up to 7 features and 15 distance ranges are considered, giving up to 350 million potential 4-point 3D pharmacophores/molecule. The resultant pharmacophore "key" ("fingerprint") serves as a powerful measure for diversity or similarity, calculable for both a ligand and a protein site, and provides a consistent frame of reference for comparing molecules, sets of molecules, and protein sites. Explicit "on-the-fly" conformational sampling is performed for a molecule to enable the calculation of all geometries accessible for all combinations of four features (i.e., 4-point pharmacophores) at any desired sampling resolution. For a protein site, complementary site points to groups displayed in the site are generated and all combinations of four site points are considered. In this paper we report (i) the details of our customized implementation of the method and its modification to systematically measure 4-point pharmacophores relative to a "special" substructure of interest present in the molecules under study; (ii) comparisons of 3- and 4-point pharmacophore methods, highlighting the much increased resolution of the 4-point method; (iii) applications of the 4-point potential pharmacophore descriptors as a new measure of molecular similarity and diversity and for the design of focused/biased combinatorial libraries.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Tools to explore large compound databases in search for analogs of query molecules provide a strategically important support in drug discovery to help identify available analogs of any given reference or hit compound by ligand based virtual screening ({LBVS}). We recently showed that large databases can be formatted for very fast searching with various 2D-fingerprints using the city-block distance as similarity measure, in particular a 2D-atom pair fingerprint ({APfp}) and the related category extended atom pair fingerprint (Xfp) which efficiently encode molecular shape and pharmacophores, but do not perceive stereochemistry. Here we investigated related 3D-atom pair fingerprints to enable rapid stereoselective searches in the {ZINC} database (23.2 million 3D structures). {RESULTS}: Molecular fingerprints counting atom pairs at increasing through-space distance intervals were designed using either all atoms (16-bit 3DAPfp) or different atom categories (80-bit 3DXfp). These 3D-fingerprints retrieved molecular shape and pharmacophore analogs (defined by {OpenEye} {ROCS} scoring functions) of 110,000 compounds from the Cambridge Structural Database with equal or better accuracy than the 2D-fingerprints {APfp} and Xfp, and showed comparable performance in recovering actives from decoys in the {DUD} database. {LBVS} by 3DXfp or 3DAPfp similarity was stereoselective and gave very different analogs when starting from different diastereomers of the same chiral drug. Results were also different from {LBVS} with the parent 2D-fingerprints Xfp or {APfp}. 3D- and 2D-fingerprints also gave very different results in {LBVS} of folded molecules where through-space distances between atom pairs are much shorter than topological distances. {CONCLUSIONS}: 3DAPfp and 3DXfp are suitable for stereoselective searches for shape and pharmacophore analogs of query molecules in large databases. Web-browsers for searching {ZINC} by 3DAPfp and 3DXfp similarity are accessible at www.gdb.unibe.ch and should provide useful assistance to drug discovery projects. Graphical {abstractAtom} pair fingerprints based on through-space distances (3DAPfp) provide better shape encoding than atom pair fingerprints based on topological distances ({APfp}) as measured by the recovery of {ROCS} shape analogs by fp similarity.},

When virtual screening is used to speed-up the drug discovery process in pharmaceutical research, taking the right decision upon selecting or discarding a molecule prior to in vitro evaluation is of paramount importance.

Different methods for ligand-based predictive modeling have different inductive biases, with a particularly sharp contrast between 2D and 3D similarity methods. A unique aspect of ligand design is that the data that exist to test methodology have been largely man-made, and that this process of design involves prediction. By analyzing the molecular similarities of known drugs, we show that the inductive bias of the historic drug discovery process has a very strong 2D bias. In studying the performance of ligand-based modeling methods, it is critical to account for this issue in dataset preparation, use of computational controls, and in the interpretation of results.

Comparison of nicotinic drugs in competing for alpha3/beta4 receptor binding sites in this cell line and the binding sites in rat forebrain (predominantly alpha4/beta2 receptors) revealed marked differences in their Ki values, but similar rank orders of potency for agonists were observed, with the exception of anatoxin-A. The affinity of the competitive antagonist dihydro-beta-erythroidine is {\textgreater}7000 times higher at alpha4/beta2 receptors in rat forebrain than at the alpha3/beta4 receptors in these cells. The alpha3/beta4 {nAChRs} expressed in this cell line are functional, and in response to nicotinic agonists, 86Rb+ efflux was increased to levels 8-10 times the basal levels. Acetylcholine, (-)-nicotine, cytisine, carbachol, and (+/-)-epibatidine all stimulated 86Rb+ efflux, which was blocked by mecamylamine. The {EC}50 values for acetylcholine and (-)-nicotine to stimulate 86Rb+ effluxes were 114 +/- 24 and 28 +/- 4 {microM}, respectively. The rank order of potency of nicotinic antagonists in blocking the function of this alpha3/beta4 receptor was mecamylamine {\textgreater}d-tubocurarine {\textgreater}dihydro-beta-erythroidine {\textgreater}hexamethonium. Mecamylamine, d-tubocurarine, and hexamethonium blocked the function by a noncompetitive mechanism, whereas dihydro-beta-erythroidine blocked the function competitively. The {KXalpha}3 beta4R2 cell line should prove to be a very useful model for studying this subtype of {nAChRs}.},

	abstract = {Metformin, an established first-line treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes, has been associated with gastrointestinal ({GI}) adverse effects that limit its use. Histamine and serotonin have potent effects on the {GI} tract. The effects of metformin on histamine and serotonin uptake were evaluated in cell lines overexpressing several amine transporters ({OCT}1, {OCT}3 and {SERT}). Metformin inhibited histamine and serotonin uptake by {OCT}1, {OCT}3 and {SERT} in a dose-dependent manner, with {OCT}1-mediated amine uptake being most potently inhibited ({IC}50 = 1.5 {mM}). A chemoinformatics-based method known as Similarity Ensemble Approach predicted diamine oxidase ({DAO}) as an additional intestinal target of metformin, with an E-value of 7.4 × 10(-5). Inhibition of {DAO} was experimentally validated using a spectrophotometric assay with putrescine as the substrate. The Ki of metformin for {DAO} was measured to be 8.6 ± 3.1 {mM}. In this study, we found that metformin inhibited intestinal amine transporters and {DAO} at concentrations that may be achieved in the intestine after therapeutic doses. Further studies are warranted to determine the relevance of these interactions to the adverse effects of metformin on the gastrointestinal tract.},

	abstract = {The efficiency of the drug discovery process can be significantly improved using design techniques to maximize the diversity of structure databases or combinatorial libraries. Here, several physicochemical descriptors were investigated to quantify molecular diversity. Based on the 2D or 3D topological similarity of molecules, the relationship between physicochemical metrics and biological activity was studied to find valid descriptors. Several compounds were selected using those descriptors from a database containing diverse templates and 55 biological classes. It was evaluated whether the obtained subsets represent all biological properties and structural variations of the original database. In addition, hierarchical cluster analyses were used to group molecules from the parent database, which should have similar biological properties. Using various sets of structurally similar molecules, it was possible to derive quantitative measures for compound similarities in relation to biological properties. A similarity radius for 2D fingerprints and molecular steric fields was estimated; compounds within this radius of another molecule were shown to have comparable biological properties. This study demonstrates that 2D fingerprints alone or in combination with other metrics as the primary descriptor allow to handle global diversity. In addition, standard atom-pair descriptors or molecular steric fields can be used to correlate structural diversity with biological activity. Hence, the latter two descriptors can be classified as secondary descriptors useful for analog library design, while 2D fingerprints are applicable to design a general library for lead discovery. Based on these findings, an optimally diverse subset containing only 38\% of the entire {IC}93 database was generated using 2D fingerprints. Here no structure is more similar than 0.85 to any other (Tanimoto coefficient), but all biological classes were selected. This reduction of redundancy led to a child database with the same physicochemical diversity space, which contains the same information as the original database.},

In order to determine whether efficacy for the sigma receptor could be improved, a series of compounds related to the benzeneacetamides, N-substituted cis-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-N-methylcyclohexylamines, were synthesized and their structure-activity requirements were determined. The compounds were synthesized by starting with the previously reported (+/-)-, 1S,2R-(+)-, and 1R,2S-(-)-cis-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-N-methylcyclohexylamines. Analysis of sigma ([3H](+)-3-{PPP}), kappa ([3H]bremazocine and [3H]U69,593), dopamine-d2 ([3H](-)-sulpiride), and phencyclidine ({PCP}) ([3H]{TCP}) receptor binding in guinea pig brain revealed a number of highly potent and selective sigma receptor ligands. Notably, 1S,2R-cis-(-)-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl]-(2-naphthyl) acetamide [(-)-29] (Ki = 8.66 +/- 0.35 {nM}), (+/-)-cis-2-amino-4,5-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl] benzeneacetamide [(+/-)-17] (Ki = 11 +/- 3 {nM}), 1S,2R-(-)-cis-N-methyl-N-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl ) cyclohexylamine [(-)-44] (Ki = 1.3 +/- 0.3 {nM}), and 1R,2S-(+)-cis-N-methyl-N-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl ) cyclohexylamine. [(+)-44] (Ki = 6 +/- 3 {nM}) exhibited very high affinity at sigma receptors, by displacement of [3H]-(+)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-(1-propyl)piperidine [( 3H]-(+)-3-{PPP}). These compounds showed insignificant affinity for kappa, dopamine, or {PCP} receptors, making them valuable tools for the study of sigma receptors. Furthermore, these compounds also exhibited enantioselectivity ranging from 5-fold for (+)- and (-)-44 to 160-fold for (+)- and (-)-29. Several other compounds showed equivalent selectivity but displayed lower sigma receptor affinity.},

	abstract = {The antispastic agent and muscle relaxant baclofen 1 is a potent and selective agonist for bicuculline-insensitive {GABAB} receptors. For many years efforts to obtain superior {GABAB} agonists were unsuccessful. We describe the syntheses and biological properties of two new series of {GABAB} agonists, the best compounds of which are more potent than baclofen in vitro and in vivo. They were obtained by replacing the carboxylic acid group of {GABA} or baclofen derivatives with either the phosphinic acid or the methylphosphinic acid residue. Surprisingly, ethyl- and higher alkylphosphinic acid derivatives of {GABA} yielded novel {GABAB} antagonists, which are described in part 2 of this series. Structure-activity relationships of the novel {GABAB} agonists are discussed with respect to their affinities to {GABAB} receptors as well as to their effects in many functional tests in vitro and in vivo providing new muscle relaxant drugs with significantly improved side effect profiles.},

	abstract = {Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}) is a highly heritable, common psychiatric disorder that presents in childhood and that probably involves several genes. There are several lines of evidence suggesting that the nicotinic system may be functionally significant in {ADHD}: (a) nicotine promotes the release of dopamine and has been shown to improve attention in adults with {ADHD}, smokers and non-smokers; (b) {ADHD} is a significant risk factor for early initiation of cigarette smoking in children; (c) maternal cigarette smoking appears to be a risk factor for {ADHD}; (d) animal studies in rats and monkeys also suggest that nicotine may be involved in attentional systems and locomotor activity; and (e) a central nicotinic agonist, {ABT}-418, improves attention in both monkeys and {ADHD} adults. The current study examined the alpha 4 receptor, one of the sites of action of {ABT}-418. A known Cfol polymorphism within the nicotinic acetylcholine alpha 4 receptor gene, {CHRNA}4, was studied in 70 {ADHD} parent-proband trios from an ongoing sample collection of children aged 6-12 with {ADHD}, according to {DSM}-{IV} criteria. Children with known major medical or psychiatric conditions or mental retardation ({IQ} {\textless}70) were excluded from the study. The Transmission Disequilibrium Test demonstrated no evidence that variation at the nicotinic acetylcholine alpha 4 receptor Cfol polymorphism influences susceptibility to {ADHD} (P {\textgreater}0.35). The continuing sample collection will enable further study of other potential nicotinic system polymorphisms in {ADHD} in more powerful samples.},

The variety of neural network types and their application to drug discovery requires expert knowledge to choose the most appropriate approach. {AREAS} {COVERED}: In this review, the authors discuss traditional and newly emerging neural network approaches to drug discovery. Their focus is on backpropagation neural networks and their variants, self-organizing maps and associated methods, and a relatively new technique, deep learning. The most important technical issues are discussed including overfitting and its prevention through regularization, ensemble and multitask modeling, model interpretation, and estimation of applicability domain. Different aspects of using neural networks in drug discovery are considered: building structure-activity models with respect to various targets; predicting drug selectivity, toxicity profiles, {ADMET} and physicochemical properties; characteristics of drug-delivery systems and virtual screening. {EXPERT} {OPINION}: Neural networks continue to grow in importance for drug discovery. Recent developments in deep learning suggests further improvements may be gained in the analysis of large chemical data sets. It's anticipated that neural networks will be more widely used in drug discovery in the future, and applied in non-traditional areas such as drug delivery systems, biologically compatible materials, and regenerative medicine.},

Random Forest is an ensemble of unpruned classification or regression trees created by using bootstrap samples of the training data and random feature selection in tree induction. Prediction is made by aggregating (majority vote or averaging) the predictions of the ensemble. We built predictive models for six cheminformatics data sets. Our analysis demonstrates that Random Forest is a powerful tool capable of delivering performance that is among the most accurate methods to date. We also present three additional features of Random Forest: built-in performance assessment, a measure of relative importance of descriptors, and a measure of compound similarity that is weighted by the relative importance of descriptors. It is the combination of relatively high prediction accuracy and its collection of desired features that makes Random Forest uniquely suited for modeling in cheminformatics.},

	abstract = {A number of 3-heteroaryl-substituted quinuclidin-3-ol and quinuclidin-2-ene derivatives have been prepared and evaluated for muscarinic and antimuscarinic properties. The affinities of the new compounds (13, 14, 16-32, and 36-52a,b) were tested in homogenates of cerebral cortex, heart, parotid gland, and urinary bladder from guinea pigs using (-)-[3H]-3-quinuclidinyl benzilate [(-)-[3H]{QNB}] as the radioligand and in a functional assay using isolated guinea pig urinary bladder. The present compounds behaved as competitive muscarinic antagonists in the urinary bladder. The highest receptor binding affinity, Ki (cortex) = 9.6 {nM}, was observed for 3-(2-benzofuranyl)quinuclidin-2-ene (31). The corresponding 3-benzofuranyl (36) and 3-benzothienyl (37) homologues had about 3.5-fold lower affinity for cortical muscarinic receptors. All quinuclidin-3-ol derivatives (14 and 16-25) had lower binding affinities for the different muscarinic receptor subtypes than the corresponding quinuclidin-2-ene analogues when examined in the various tissue homogenates. In general, the new compounds showed low subtype selectivity. The structure-affinity relationships are discussed in terms of differences in proton basicity of the azabicyclic nitrogen and differences in geometric, conformational, and/or electronic properties of the compounds. The cortical antimuscarinic potency is also related to the complementarity of the compounds to the putative binding site of the muscarinic m1 receptor.},

A series of monosubstituted iminohomopiperidinium salts possessing lipophilic functionality at ring positions 3, 5, 6, and 7 has been synthesized, and series members have demonstrated the ability to inhibit the {hiNOS} isoform with an {IC}50 as low as 160 {nM} (7). Compounds were found that selectively inhibit {hiNOS} over the human endothelial constitutive enzyme ({heNOS}) with a {heNOS}/{hiNOS} {IC}50 ratio in excess of 100 and as high as 314 (9). Potencies for inhibition of {hiNOS} and the human neuronal constitutive enzyme ({hnNOS}) are comparable. Substitution in the 3 and 7 positions provides compounds that exhibit the greatest degree of selectivity for {hiNOS} and {hnNOS} over {heNOS}. Submicromolar potencies for 6 and 7 in a mouse {RAW} cell assay demonstrated the ability of these compounds to inhibit {iNOS} in a cellular environment. These latter compounds were also found to be orally bioavailable and efficacious due to their ability to inhibit the increase in plasma nitrite/nitrate levels in a rat {LPS} model.},

	volume = {105},
	url = {https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1628159},
	abstract = {1. The purpose of the present study was to relate the effects of the novel drug, anpirtoline, on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-{HT}) receptor subtypes to its antinociceptive and antidepressant-like actions in rodents. 2. Binding assays with rat brain membranes have shown that anpirtoline bound with a much higher affinity to 5-{HT}1B receptor (Ki = 28 {nM}) than to 5-{HT}1A (Ki = 150 {nM}) and 5-{HT}2 (Ki = 1.49 {microM}) receptors. 3. Like 5-{HT}, anpirtoline concentration-dependently inhibited forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in homogenates from the rat substantia nigra. Both effects were not additive, and could be prevented by 5-{HT}1B receptor antagonists such as propranolol and penbutolol. 4. In superfused rat and pig brain cortex slices preincubated with [3H]-5-{HT}, the electrically evoked tritium overflow was inhibited by anpirtoline and 5-{HT}. Whereas 5-{HT} was equipotent in both tissues ({EC}50 = 69 {nM}), anpirtoline was markedly less potent in pig brain cortex slices ({EC}50 = 1190 {nM}) than in rat brain cortex slices ({EC}50 = 55 {nM}). The concentration-response curve for anpirtoline was shifted to the right by metitepine in both preparations. 5. In the social behaviour deficit test, anpirtoline and trifluoromethylphenyl-piperazine were effective in reversing the isolation-induced impairments in mice, an effect shown only by compounds with agonist properties at the 5-{HT}1B receptor. 6. In the electrostimulated pain test using mice, anpirtoline dose-dependently increased the pain threshold with an {ED}50 of 0.52 mg kg-1, i.p. The antinociceptive activity of anpirtoline was abolished by pretreatment with cyproheptadine or propranolol.7. In the forced swimming test in rats, anpirtoline induced a dose-related increase in swimming activity. With an {ED}50 value of 4.6mgkg-1, i.p., anpirtoline was 4 times more potent than the two standard compounds imipramine and desipramine. The decrease of immobility time or the increase of active periods in this model of behavioural despair is suggested to be characteristic of antidepressant drugs.8. Anpirtoline exhibits both antinociceptive and antidepressant-like activities in animals. It is probable that anpirtoline elicits these pharmacological effects via its agonist effect on 5-{HT}1B and 5-{HT}1A receptors.},

This updated molecular set has been used herein to develop 4D {QSAR} models based on "inductive" descriptors and to gain insight into the molecular basis of protein-ligand interactions. Molecular alignment was generated by means of docking active compounds into the active site of the {SHBG}. Surprisingly, the alignment of the benchmark steroids contradicted the classical ligand-based alignment utilized in previous {CoMFA} and {CoMSIA} models yet afforded models with higher statistical significance and predictive power. The resulting {QSAR} models combined with {CoMFA} and {CoMSiA} models as well as structure-based virtual screening allowed discovering several low-micromolar to nanomolar nonsteroidal inhibitors for human {SHBG}.},

Using the structure-activity relationships of C2-symmetric diol inhibitors, computed-aided drug design tools, and first principles, we designed and synthesized a novel class of cyclic ureas that incorporates this structural water and preorganizes the side chain residues into optimum binding conformations. Conformational analysis suggested a preference for pseudodiaxial benzylic and pseudodiequatorial hydroxyl substituents and an enantiomeric preference for the Rstereochemistry. The X-ray and solution {NMR} structure of the complex of {HIV}-1PR and one such cyclic urea, {DMP}323, confirmed the displacement of the structural water. Additionally, the bound and "unbound" (small-molecule X-ray) ligands have similar conformations. The high degree of preorganization, the complementarity, and the entropic gain of water displacement are proposed to explain the high affinity of these small molecules for the enzyme. The small size probably contributes to the observed good oral bioavailability in animals. Extensive structure-based optimization of the side chains that fill the S2 and S2' pockets of the enzyme resulted in {DMP}323, which was studied in phase I clinical trials but found to suffer from variable pharmacokinetics in man. This report details the synthesis, conformational analysis, structure-activity relationships, and molecular recognition of this series of C2-symmetry {HIV}-1PR inhibitors. An initial series of cyclic ureas containing nonsymmetric P2/P2' is also discussed.},

Anpirtoline (1.0 ng kg(-1)-1.0 micrograms kg-1 i.p.) reduced the aversive responding of mice. This was detected as an increase in the latency to locate the non-aversive compartment and by decreases in the percentage of the time spent in the dark compartment, and the numbers of rears and line crossings in the dark compartment. In radioligand binding studies anpirtoline displayed submicromolar affinity for 5-{HT}1A, 5-{HT}1B and 5-{HT}3 receptor recognition sites (Ki = 151, 28 and 30 {nM}, respectively) and more modest affinity for 5-{HT}2 receptor recognition sites (Ki = 1.48 {microM}).

With sufficiently rich phenotyping and a large sampling of compounds, it should be possible to identify compounds with desired mechanisms of action on the basis of behavioral profiles alone. Although zebrafish (Danio rerio) behavior has been used to rapidly identify neuroactive compounds, it is not clear what types of behavioral assays would be necessary to identify multitarget compounds such as antipsychotics. Here we developed a battery of behavioral assays in larval zebrafish to determine whether behavioral profiles can provide sufficient phenotypic resolution to identify and classify psychiatric drugs. Using the antipsychotic drug haloperidol as a test case, we found that behavioral profiles of haloperidol-treated zebrafish could be used to identify previously uncharacterized compounds with desired antipsychotic-like activities and multitarget mechanisms of action.},

Of the approximately 350 nonolfactory human {GPCRs}, more than 100 are still considered to be 'orphans' because their endogenous ligands remain unknown. Here, we describe a unique open-source resource that allows interrogation of the druggable human {GPCRome} via a G protein-independent β-arrestin-recruitment assay. We validate this unique platform at more than 120 nonorphan human {GPCR} targets, demonstrate its utility for discovering new ligands for orphan human {GPCRs} and describe a method (parallel receptorome expression and screening via transcriptional output, with transcriptional activation following arrestin translocation ({PRESTO}-Tango)) for the simultaneous and parallel interrogation of the entire human nonolfactory {GPCRome}.},

	abstract = {Advantages like intuitive interpretation, objectivity, general applicability, and its easy, automated calculation make the rmsd (root-mean-squared deviation) the measure of choice for the investigation of the accuracy of conformational model generators. For comparing conformations of a single molecule this is a clearly superior method. Single molecule analysis is, however, a rare scenario. Typically, conformations are generated for huge corporate or external vendor databases of high diversity which are then further investigated with high-throughput computational methods like docking or pharmacophore searching, in virtual screening campaigns. Representative subsets for accuracy investigations of computational methods need to mimic this diversity. Averaged rmsd values over these data sets are frequently used to assess the accuracy of the methods. There are, however, significant weaknesses in rmsd comparisons for such kind of data sets. The interpretation is for example no longer intuitive because what can be expected in terms of good or bad rmsd values crucially depends on the data set composition like size or number of rotatable bonds of the underlying molecules. Further, rmsd lacks normalization which might result in very high averaged rmsd values for highly flexible molecules and thus might completely skew results. We have developed a novel measure to compare conformations of molecules called Torsion Fingerprint Deviation ({TFD}). It extracts, weights, and compares Torsion Fingerprints from a query molecule and generated conformations under consideration of acyclic bonds as well as ring systems. {TFD} is alignment-free and overcomes major limitations of rmsd while retaining its advantages.},

The classifiers were obtained using sets of known {COX}-2 and thrombin inhibitors as "positive examples" and a large collection of screening compounds as "negative examples". Molecules were encoded by topological pharmacophore-point triangles. In retrospective virtual screening, 50-90\% of the known active compounds were listed within the first 0.1\% of the ranked database. To check the validity of the constructed classifiers, we developed a method for feature extraction and visualization using {SVM}. As a result, potential pharmacophore points were weighted according to their importance for {COX}-2 and thrombin inhibition. Known thrombin and {COX}-2 pharmacophore points were correctly recognized by the machine learning system. In a prospective virtual screening study, several potential {COX}-2 inhibitors were predicted and tested in a cellular activity assay. A benzimidazole derivative exhibited significant inhibitory activity with an {IC}(50) of 0.2 {microM}, which is better than Celecoxib in our assay. It was demonstrated that the {SVM} machine-learning method can be used in virtual screening and be analyzed in a human-interpretable way that results in a set of rules for designing novel molecules.},

	abstract = {The M(5) muscarinic receptor is the most recent member of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor family (M(1)-M(5)) to be cloned. At present, the physiological relevance of this receptor subtype remains unknown, primarily because of its low expression levels and the lack of M(5) receptor-selective ligands. To circumvent these difficulties, we used gene targeting technology to generate M(5) receptor-deficient mice (M5R(-/-) mice). M5R(-/-) mice did not differ from their wild-type littermates in various behavioral and pharmacologic tests. However, in vitro neurotransmitter release experiments showed that M(5) receptors play a role in facilitating muscarinic agonist-induced dopamine release in the striatum. Because M(5) receptor {mRNA} has been detected in several blood vessels, we also investigated whether the lack of M(5) receptors led to changes in vascular tone by using several in vivo and in vitro vascular preparations. Strikingly, acetylcholine, a powerful dilator of most vascular beds, virtually lost the ability to dilate cerebral arteries and arterioles in M5R(-/-) mice. This effect was specific for cerebral blood vessels, because acetylcholine-mediated dilation of extra-cerebral arteries remained fully intact in M5R(-/-) mice. Our findings provide direct evidence that M(5) muscarinic receptors are physiologically relevant. Because it has been suggested that impaired cholinergic dilation of cerebral blood vessels may play a role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease and focal cerebral ischemia, cerebrovascular M(5) receptors may represent an attractive therapeutic target.},

	abstract = {Muscarinic cholinergic receptors of the M5 subtype are expressed by dopamine-containing neurons of the ventral tegmentum. These M5 receptors modulate the activity of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, which play an important role in mediating reinforcing properties of abused psychostimulants like cocaine. The potential role of M5 receptors in the reinforcing effects of cocaine was investigated using M5 receptor-deficient mice in a model of acute cocaine self-administration. The M5-deficient mice self-administered cocaine at a significantly lower rate than wild-type controls. In the conditioned place preference procedure, a classic test for evaluating the rewarding properties of drugs, M5-deficient mice spent significantly less time in the cocaine-paired compartment than control mice. Moreover, the severity of the cocaine withdrawal syndrome (withdrawal-associated anxiety measured in the elevated plus-maze) was significantly attenuated in mice lacking the M5 receptor. These results demonstrate that M5 receptors play an important role in mediating both cocaine-associated reinforcement and withdrawal. Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {The sc-{PDB} is a collection of 6 415 three-dimensional structures of binding sites found in the Protein Data Bank ({PDB}). Binding sites were extracted from all high-resolution crystal structures in which a complex between a protein cavity and a small-molecular-weight ligand could be identified. Importantly, ligands are considered from a pharmacological and not a structural point of view. Therefore, solvents, detergents, and most metal ions are not stored in the sc-{PDB}. Ligands are classified into four main categories: nucleotides ({\textless}4-mer), peptides ({\textless}9-mer), cofactors, and organic compounds. The corresponding binding site is formed by all protein residues (including amino acids, cofactors, and important metal ions) with at least one atom within 6.5 angstroms of any ligand atom. The database was carefully annotated by browsing several protein databases ({PDB}, {UniProt}, and {GO}) and storing, for every sc-{PDB} entry, the following features: protein name, function, source, domain and mutations, ligand name, and structure. The repository of ligands has also been archived by diversity analysis of molecular scaffolds, and several chemoinformatics descriptors were computed to better understand the chemical space covered by stored ligands. The sc-{PDB} may be used for several purposes: (i) screening a collection of binding sites for predicting the most likely target(s) of any ligand, (ii) analyzing the molecular similarity between different cavities, and (iii) deriving rules that describe the relationship between ligand pharmacophoric points and active-site properties. The database is periodically updated and accessible on the web at http://bioinfo-pharma.u-strasbg.fr/{scPDB}/.},

The use of {ROCS} led to the identification of a set of novel, weakly binding inhibitors with scaffolds presenting synthetic opportunities to further optimize biological affinity and lacking development issues associated with the {HTS} lead. These {ROCS}-identified scaffolds would have been missed using other structural similarity approaches such as {ISIS} 2D fingerprints. X-ray crystallographic analysis of one of the new inhibitors bound to {ZipA} reveals that the shape comparison approach very accurately predicted the binding mode.

	abstract = {Computational tools to search chemical structure databases are essential to finding leads early in a drug discovery project. Similarity methods are among the most diverse and most useful. We will present some lessons we have gathered over many years experience with in-house methods on several therapeutic problems. The effectiveness of any similarity method can vary greatly from one biological activity to another in a way that is difficult to predict. Also, any two methods tend to select different subsets of actives from a database, so it is advisable to use several search methods where possible.},

	abstract = {The binding of drugs and reagents to off-targets is well-known. Whereas many off-targets are related to the primary target by sequence and fold, many ligands bind to unrelated pairs of proteins, and these are harder to anticipate. If the binding site in the off-target can be related to that of the primary target, this challenge resolves into aligning the two pockets. However, other cases are possible: the ligand might interact with entirely different residues and environments in the off-target, or wholly different ligand atoms may be implicated in the two complexes. To investigate these scenarios at atomic resolution, the structures of 59 ligands in 116 complexes (62 pairs in total), where the protein pairs were unrelated by fold but bound an identical ligand, were examined. In almost half of the pairs, the ligand interacted with unrelated residues in the two proteins (29 pairs), and in 14 of the pairs wholly different ligand moieties were implicated in each complex. Even in those 19 pairs of complexes that presented similar environments to the ligand, ligand superposition rarely resulted in the overlap of related residues. There appears to be no single pattern-matching "code" for identifying binding sites in unrelated proteins that bind identical ligands, though modeling suggests that there might be a limited number of different patterns that suffice to recognize different ligand functional groups.},

Retrospective analysis of recently marketed oral drugs shows that they frequently have highly optimized ligand efficiency values for their targets. Optimizing ligand efficiency metrics based on both molecular mass and lipophilicity, when set in the context of the specific target, has the potential to ameliorate the inflation of these properties that has been observed in current medicinal chemistry practice, and to increase the quality of drug candidates.},

	abstract = {Binding of nicotine to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ({nAChRs}) elicits a series of dose-dependent behaviors that go from altered exploration, sedation, and tremors, to seizures and death. {nAChRs} are pentameric ion channels usually composed of alpha and beta subunits. A gene cluster comprises the alpha3, alpha5 and beta4 subunits, which coassemble to form functional receptors. We examined the role of the beta4 subunits in nicotine-induced seizures and hypolocomotion in beta4 homozygous null (beta4 -/-) and alpha3 heterozygous (+/-) mice. beta4 -/- mice were less sensitive to the effects of nicotine both at low doses, measured as decreased exploration in an open field, and at high doses, measured as sensitivity to nicotine-induced seizures. Using in situ hybridization probes for the alpha3 and alpha5 subunits, we showed that alpha5 {mRNA} levels are unchanged, whereas alpha3 {mRNA} levels are selectively decreased in the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb, and the inferior and the superior colliculus of beta4 -/- brains. alpha3 +/- mice were partially resistant to nicotine-induced seizures when compared to wild-type littermates. {mRNA} levels for the alpha5 and the beta4 subunits were unchanged in alpha3 +/- brains. Together, these results suggest that the beta4 and the alpha3 subunits are mediators of nicotine-induced seizures and hypolocomotion.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo has proven a remarkable empirical success, but only recently have we begun to develop a rigorous understanding of why it performs so well on difficult problems and how it is best applied in practice. Unfortunately, that understanding is confined within the mathematics of differential geometry which has limited its dissemination, especially to the applied communities for which it is particularly important. In this review I provide a comprehensive conceptual account of these theoretical foundations, focusing on developing a principled intuition behind the method and its optimal implementations rather of any exhaustive rigor. Whether a practitioner or a statistician, the dedicated reader will acquire a solid grasp of how Hamiltonian Monte Carlo works, when it succeeds, and, perhaps most importantly, when it fails.},

The approach can support control flow, nesting, mutation, recursion, data structures, higher-order functions, and other language constructs, and the output is given to an existing compiler to produce highly efficient differentiated code. Our implementation is a new {AD} tool for the Julia language, called Zygote, which presents high-level dynamic semantics while transparently compiling adjoint code under the hood.
